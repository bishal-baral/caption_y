{"title": "A Friend in Need Is a Friend Indeed", "content": "What are you waiting for? Get an ambulance. Please leave the room, darling. You know I like to bathe in private. [ Stuttering ] Mark, I didn't mean to kill her. [ Laughing ] Okay? Okay. Take it easy! What are you trying to do, break my head? Say it. Yes, darling, completely. You're wasting your time and my time and the department's time. [ Raspberrying ] I left Margaret at home. [ Splashing ] [ Phone ringing ] Yes? Is, uh, is Mark there? It's important. Sorry, Hugh. It's Tuesday. Club night. Oh, right. Um, well, I'll... I'll get him at the club. Mr. Caldwell, good to see you, sir. Oh, yes, Charles. Thank you. I, uh, I'm looking for Mr. Halperin. Over there, sir. The usual Tuesday night game, you know? Mr. Lawrence is having quite a run with the dice. Simply amazing. I've never... Hugh, how are you? It's been forever.( Hugh) Fine, honey.( Lawrence) Play it for$3, 200, Mark, unless you want to resign at$1, 600. Hi, Hugh. Hi, Mark. Byron, I think your dice are about to turn cold. [ Chuckles ] The Army may have taught you bravery, Mark, but I'm not so sure about your judgment. You still need doubles to win. [ Dice clattering ] [ Laughing ] You see, Byron, sometimes a little boldness is exactly what's called for. Uh, Mark, excuse me. Huh? Could I talk to you for a second? What's the matter? I just... I'd just like to see you for a second. All right. Be back in a minute. Don't go away, huh. What's the matter? Nothing. I just want to talk to you for a minute. Something wrong? No. Danny, bring us a double Scotch, will you? Yes, sir, Mr. Halperin. Right away. Are you sure she's dead? Yeah. [ Sniffling ] It just happened. We were... we were fighting. We were screaming at each other. I was sure she was gonna see somebody tonight. She came at me, and I must have grabbed her by the throat. All right. Take it easy. Take it easy. I didn't know what I was doing. I just saw her face looking up at me and then when I realized what I was doing, I let her go. And she just fell. Calm down. Calm down. Mark, you gotta tell me what to do. All right. Now, was there anyone else in the house when this happened? Was the maid there? No, she, uh, she left about 8: 15, when I got home. Right. Right. Did you call anyone? Just your place. Margaret told me you were here. But you didn't say anything to her? No. Or maybe I should call Fred. He doesn't handle criminal cases, but he must know somebody... No. No. Or maybe I should go to the police. Mark, I didn't mean to kill her. Hugh, you can't afford to do that. Everyone knows the problems you and Janice were having. Now, listen to me. It's almost 10: 00. I want you to go in the other bar, there are more people in there. At exactly 10: 30, I want you to call your house. I'll answer the phone. You pretend it's Janice. Make sure the bartender and anyone else in the bar overhears your conversation. Why? You want me to help you, don't you? All right. Do as I say. All right, Mark. Fine. [ Phone ringing ] Janice, is that you? Are you in a bar? Everything's just fine. Now listen to me. She's gone to bed early, she's not going to wait up for you. Do you understand? Yes, yes, darling. Of course, you must be exhausted. Get a good night's sleep, and I'll see you in the morning. Say it. All right, you get a good night's sleep, and I'll see you in the morning, huh? All right. Fine, Hugh. You're doing just fine. Now listen to me. You stay right there in the bar and don't move until the police contact you. Do you understand? Yes. Yes, dear. Yes. Perfectly. [ Piano playing ] Yes, good night, darling. Ah, she's been out all day shopping. She's exhausted. Yes, sir. She's gettin' ready for bed now. I guess it won't hurt to have another one.( Margaret) Mark, is that you? It's me. Hi. Ah. You're home early tonight, Mark. Yeah. [ Sighs ] I was a little tired. What's this? Another one of your bleeding- heart friends get into print? Did you win tonight, Mark, or is that a silly question? Oddly enough, I did. Wonderful. Yeah. That means I won't have to write you a check this week. That will be refreshing. [ Mark chuckling ] Won't it be? For both of us. Did I tell you I'm speaking at the Holcombe House tomorrow evening? They've named me\" Woman of the Year.\" Really? How much is that going to cost you? Oh, don't be crude. My, my,\" Woman of the Year,\" that's quite an honor. Playing queen bee to a motley assortment of junkies, pushers, and losers. You know, I don't know how much money you've pumped into your assorted charities, Margaret, but it's a lot more than any$10 trophy they're going to hand you. Not tonight, please. Darling, if you're embarrassed by all your millions, why don't you just sign them over to me? [ Chuckles ] They wouldn't embarrass me in the least. Money is a weapon, Mark, a tool to be used for good, if it's used properly. Hmm. Properly? I see. That means handing it out like Halloween candy to a bunch of grifters who've never done a day's work in their lives?' Cause nobody has ever given them a chance. Come on, Margaret. Do you know what it's like to be an ex- convict trying to find honest work? Margaret, please. Please don't lecture me on ex- cons. I wrote that book. [ Sighing ]( Mark) Margaret.( Margaret) What is it? A man. I just saw a man running from the Caldwell house. What? Yeah. All the lights are on over there. I don't like the looks of that. I don't see anyone. Uh, do you think the man could have been Hugh? No, no, I left Hugh at the club. There's no answer. I think something's wrong. Sergeant, this is Deputy Commissioner Halperin. Uh, I just saw a man, a strange man, running from a house on, uh... on Fairfax Drive. I want you to dispatch a unit over there immediately. Will you? Uh, the number is 1278 Fairfax Drive. Right. [ Policemen chattering ] I dropped my cigar. Is that it there, Lieutenant? Where? Under there. Wait a minute. I don't want to burn up the Commissioner's car. Oh. I got it. I grabbed the wrong end. Come here, you little rascal. Okay. That looks okay. Officer, do me a favor, huh? Look under there and make sure nothing's burning.( officer) All right, Lieutenant. Uh, everything's okay, Lieutenant. You sure? Positive. Look again. Right, Lieutenant.( Mark) What's missing?( Duffy) Just her jewelry. He never went near the paintings nor the silverware. There's a vase out there worth a couple of thousand dollars. He never touched that. It's the same guy, all right. All right, I want you to pick up every known burglar in the morning. If you talked to them before, talk to them again. If you need any extra men, let me know. Yes, sir. Columbo, it's about time you showed up. Yes sir. I'm sorry. It was my car. The battery went dead. Commissioner, your car is here now. Thank you. Tried to get my wife's car. She was at my sister- in- law's, so I called there... It's a boring story. Thank you very much for sending your car. I appreciate it. It's quite all right. Duffy will fill you in on what's happened. It's the same man who's been hitting this area in the past few weeks. The M. O.' s identical. I see. Well, maybe I better look around. Good looking broad except for the marks around her neck. Certainly is.( Columbo) What do you figure happened? Looks like she was getting ready to hit the sack. Probably heard the guy down here, came down to see what was goin' on. Could've just called us, but she's gotta make like a hero, right? How long has she been dead? Not too long. She talked to her husband on the phone about an hour ago. Yeah, an hour ago. Okay. It's all yours. Thank you. Find anything yet?( Randall) Just a few smudges on this jewelry box. But everything else looks pretty clean. [ Sniffing ] Sergeant, did you dust these handles yet?( Randall) Not yet, Lieutenant. Well, let me know if you find anything. I think you're wasting your time, Lieutenant. This is the fourth time I've been in this neighborhood in two weeks. Now this guy's good. Wears gloves. Never leaves me a print. Well, let me know if you find anything. Right away, sir.( Mark) We will provide protection for all our citizens, not just those in the inner city or in the so- called problem areas. Now, the brutal murder, last night, of Janice Caldwell is a scathing indictment of the police department's failure, of our failure, to cope with crime on the most fundamental levels. [ Raspberrying ]( bartender) What's the matter, Artie? Don't you believe in law and order? That guy gives me a pain.( bartender) I'll turn it off. I thought we were going shopping. I told you I have to wait for somebody here. Yeah? Well, he'd better hurry up because you're not spending any afternoon in this place. I hate this place. And you know I hate this place. But I like it. Did you get the tickets yet? What tickets?\" What tickets?\" I told you, we're going to the roller derby tonight. Hey, are you crazy? I'm not going to any roller derby. A month... You've been out a whole month and you haven't taken me anyplace. You think you can hang around this place again with your old pals from prison. What's left of them. Guess again, Artie. Hey! This is my place of business. You don't have to come in here! So, don't come in here! We're goin' out. That's what you think! Where have you been? I've been waiting for you for over an hour now. I got hung up. I got the stuff at my joint from the other night.( Sharkey) Are you kiddin'? I wouldn't touch any of it. Not after what happened last night. Killin' that woman? Are you crazy? That wasn't me. Come on, you've been hittin' that neighborhood pretty good. The other joints, sure. But the one last night, that wasn't me. [ Laughs ] Okay, have it your way. But I can't handle your goods. Not with the kind of heat I'll be getting. I should've known better than to deal with a punk like you. Johnny Romano, Carlos Vera, they were men. Yeah, but they're dead. Times change. It's tougher on the outside now. [ Laughs ] You know, you spent so much time up in that prison, you don't know how it is any more. You all through? Come on, let's get those tickets. I wanna sit real close. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. You can walk faster. Come on. Will you shut up? Commissioner, specifically what steps are you taking to offset this rash of crime in the Bel Air area? Well, I've ordered a double shift on all squad cars, sunset- to- sunrise helicopter patrol. As a matter of fact, I plan to be in that chopper myself tonight to get a firsthand look at this operation. We're going to get this man, and we're gonna get him soon. Whoever he is, wherever he is, he's not going to be able to escape detection indefinitely. Now, last night he made his first mistake. My wife and I were in our bedroom when he ran from the Caldwell house. Well, he's gonna make other mistakes. When he does, we'll get him, and we'll hit him with a first- degree- murder charge that will stick. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Now, If you'll excuse me... Does that mean your wife can identify this man as well as yourself? Sir, sir, can your wife identify this man? [ Birds chirping ] Ma'am. [ Exclaiming ] [ Laughs ] You startled me. Oh, I'm sorry. What happened? I tore my... On the cactus, I... Oh, I'm sorry. It was very clumsy of me. No, no, it was my fault, ma'am. I frightened you. I'm sorry about that. L... I know you, don't I? Yes, ma'am, you do. L... I was afraid you'd remember. It was at the chief inspector's dinner last year at the hotel. I was a little drunk. Lt. Columbo. Oh, isn't it perfectly awful? Janice Caldwell had so much to give. I'm sure she'd have found her way. Yes, ma'am. That's what I wanted to ask you about. You being close friends and all. Several people have told me that she and her husband were, um... Well, that is, that she... Well, they were having problems. Was she seeing other men? Is that what you wanted to know? Uh, yes, ma'am. Surely that can't make any difference now. Probably not, but I'd appreciate it if you could give me a few names. I'm sorry. I never pried into Janice's personal affairs. Once, last year, I, I did try talking to her. She became very defensive, almost violent. Then she was seeing other men? Yes. Young men, I believe. Men I didn't know. Thank you, ma'am. You've been very helpful. Uh, Mrs. Halperin, one other thing. Last night, the burglar... Your husband gave us a description. He saw him running from the Caldwell house. Yes, from our bedroom window. Now, I understand you were also in the bedroom. So, I would like to check your description with his. Oh, I... I didn't see him. By the time I got to the terrace, he had gone. You weren't at the window? No. Where were you? Well, I was in bed, and then I went to the window. Oh. Thank you, ma'am. Uh, one other thing, Mrs. Halperin. The Caldwell house? It's on the next block, is it? Yes. Right across the street. Number 1278. Yeah, I know the address. I was there this morning. I, I was just trying to visualize the proximity. Thank you. [ Gate creaking ] Excuse me, sir. A police officer to see you. The same one who was here this morning when you were out. Yes. Uh, would you ask him to come in, please? Excuse me, sir. I hate to trouble you at this time. Lt. Columbo. Yes, Lieutenant. My maid said you were here earlier. L... I'm sorry, I had to make arrangements... I hate to bother you like this. Like a cup of coffee, Lieutenant? No.( Hugh) I'm afraid I've been drinking too much coffee today, but I didn't sleep very well last night. Thank you very much. Is there, uh... Something wrong, Lieutenant? Wrong? No, sir. Not at all. Couple of things I want to clear up just to satisfy myself. Satisfy yourself, how? The way your wife died, Mr. Caldwell. Couple of small things. Probably don't mean anything. I spoke to your maid, Mrs. Um... Fernandez. She's a nice lady. I guess she worked very long hours yesterday. It must have been a big cleaning day. Well, I really wouldn't know. Apparently, your wife was out shopping all day. Mrs. Fernandez left here at, uh... Oh, it was after 8: 00, Lieutenant. And my wife and I arrived home about the same time. Your wife was downstairs? Right. In the living room, having a drink. Mrs. Fernandez says she was wearing a red dress. Yes, I believe it was. I see. And then you went out? 9: 00. Yes. Was your wife still wearing the red dress? Yes, Lieutenant. Look, we had a couple of drinks. I left. Now, she didn't get ready for bed until I called her around 10: 30. At the club? They found you at the bar when the police finally located you. That's right, Lieutenant. Look, Janice apparently went upstairs to change. She put on her nightgown, heard a noise, came down, and surprised this burglar. I mean, I should think the facts would speak for themselves. It's very strange. See, there's one thing that's very strange. And what's that, Lieutenant? Mrs. Fernandez dusted the whole house. Wax, polish, everything. Including the bedroom. Now, the fingerprint people, they checked the handle on the closet door. Your wife's prints weren't on it. What I can't figure out is how did she open the door and take out the nightgown without leaving any prints? That's very simple, Lieutenant. You see, my wife was in the habit of folding her nightgown every morning when she got up and putting it under her pillow. Don't you see? She had no reason to go to the closet. Yes. Yes. I see. Yes. That would explain it. Yes, it certainly would. Well, thank you. No, not at all, Lieutenant. [ Engine conking out ] [ Engine stalling ] [ Engine stalling ] Excuse me, sir? Sir? Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am! You got some jumpers for a battery? No. Listen, there's a gas station up ahead. Would you drive me over there? Thank you. Columbo? Excuse me, sir. I didn't mean to barge in. I looked for your secretary. I guess she's powdering her nose or something. May I, uh... I would've been here earlier, but my car broke down again. I had some more trouble. They're telling me it's the generator... If you don't mind, Lieutenant, I'm in something of a hurry. I'm making real progress. So, I thought... Finish your report? No, I haven't. Well, finish the report and I'll read it. Right now, I've gotta get home and get something to eat. I'm on that chopper patrol tonight. I understand, sir. Just take a minute. I know you're in a hurry. Before I actually fill out the report, if I could just double- check that description that you had... It was hardly a description. I barely got a glimpse of him. Right. You did say, uh, dark sweater.( Mark) That's right. Dark pants. And some kind of cap. And a dark cap. Dark cap. Dark... That's it, then. Just dark? It was night, Lieutenant. And I was a long way away. Uh, that's too bad. That's what your wife said. You spoke to my wife, did you? I thought you left. What was that you said? I say, you spoke to my wife. Yes, there's nothing wrong? No. Certainly not. No, you know, you see, it was just that on the basis of the news conference this morning, I thought that she also saw the burglar. That's ridiculous. He was gone by the time she got to the terrace. Yes, sir. That's what she said. But you certainly gave that impression, so I thought... Look, Lieutenant, if you don't mind, I've got to go now, my limousine is waiting. There are a couple of other things... Give my secretary a call in the morning, I'll try to find some time for you. Oh, Mark, you frightened me. What are you doing home so early? Oh, I thought I'd get an early supper. Please leave the room, darling. You know I like to bathe in private. [ Chuckles ] Come on, Margaret. Don't be so coy. You know, you wear those bubbles like a suit of armor. Come on, Mark. I'll only be a minute. Have I told you recently, darling, that our marriage has been a constant joy to me? Huh? Have I? No, you haven't. Well, it has. I think the first thing that appealed to me about you, Margaret, was your... your generosity, that sweet open- handed quality of yours. Although sometimes your... your judgment's not so good. You know that, don't you? [ Laughing ] What are you saying? Well,$4. 5 million and you're willing to hand it out to anybody who has a sad story and a rumpled suit. It's my money, Mark. My inheritance. Wrong, darling. My inheritance. [ Grunting ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Organ playing ] Thanks for coming. Where's Margaret? She's at home. A closed casket, huh? Couldn't bear to look her in the face. Mark, I don't know how to thank you. If it hadn't been for you last night... You'd be facing a murder charge. If there's anything I can ever do for you... There is, my friend. Tonight. If you gentlemen want to finish paying your respects to the loved one, we will be closing up until 8: 30. I left Margaret at home. She's lying on the tile floor near the front door. She's dead. Good Lord, Mark. [ Whispering ] Quiet. How? She drowned in the bathtub. Only, the police are never gonna know that. They're gonna think the notorious Bel Air Burglar killed her. And you must see to that. What are you talking about? I can't get involved. You are involved, my friend. This is the quid pro quo. You killed your wife and I protected you. Now you protect me or I'll see to it that you go to jail for the rest of your life. Is that clear? Yes, perfectly. All right. Now, I left some clothes in a pile by the front door. Here's what I want you to do. [ Helicopter whirring ] This is Chopper One. This is Chopper One. Baker Seven, do you read me? Over.( patrolman) This is Baker Seven. We see you, Chopper One. Okay, we're heading east. 10- 4. A little early in the evening for this burglar, isn't it, Commissioner? You never know, Pete. Clocks don't mean a thing in an empty house, you know. Yeah, except last night the house wasn't empty. That's funny. What is it? That's my house down there. And I saw someone lurking near my wife's car. He' s disappeared. Circle around here, Pete, will you? Yes, sir. My God, Margaret. Hover over the pool. I'm gonna try to get out. Yes, sir. Help me! Quick! Please, for God's sake! What are you waiting for? Get an ambulance for God's sake. Margaret. Margaret. My God, Margaret. She's gone, sir. What do you mean? You're crazy. She's gonna be all right. Get an ambulance! Margaret. Lieutenant, I just heard. Terrible. The Commissioner, how's he holding up? They got him in the kitchen. They're putting some dry clothes on him now. It's not too bad, I tell you. The burglar, huh? Yeah. It's funny, though. Very funny. What? There's no sign that he forced his way into the house. As near as we can figure it, he was laying for her, out in the back by the car.( Randall) Lieutenant! Excuse me, Columbo. Lt. Duffy, sir. Yes, sir.( Doyle) Just keep circling around. He's got to be around here somewhere. Yeah, well, keep looking. That's right.( Columbo) What happened, Doc? See for yourself, Columbo. She drowned. In a pool? Guy tossed her in a pool? That's it. Wonder why she didn't swim? Probably couldn't swim. Well, maybe she passed out, Lieutenant. What are we gonna do? He didn't hit her first? No marks? No struggle? There might've been a struggle. She gotta tear on her sleeve.( officer) Hey, Doyle? Yeah. Yeah. No, that happened this afternoon. She tore it on a cactus bush. I was there when it happened.( officer) This guy just pulled up out front.( Al) I've come to see Ms. Halperin.( officer) What about? Well, she was supposed to come to our meeting tonight and get an award, that's all. The way things look around here, I'd like to get out of here. What did you say? A meeting? She was supposed to get an award? Yeah, Holcombe House. Gonna have dinner at 8: 00. And she was gonna make a little speech and pick up her trophy. I called her house when she didn't show. Line was always busy, so I came over. She was supposed to have dinner with you at 8: 00 and make a speech? That's where she was going when the guy jumped her. Where were you at 7: 30? I was at the place, settin' up. Relax, huh. You're making me nervous. You can prove it, right? Prove it? Yeah. I can prove it. I'll bet you can. All right, Doyle. Take this gentleman's name and let him go. Don't talk to me about manpower allocations! Now, this man killed my wife and I want him! Now, you get three units over here and get them over fast. You're gonna answer to me in the morning. Excuse me, Commissioner, I just want to tell you how badly I feel. And if there's anything that I can do... No, no, thank you. Mark, I want you to take those pills... What? I want you to take the pills that I gave you... All right, I'll take the pills. I'm shocked. Terribly shocking. The man is obviously insane. I mean, to come back here and do this... Particularly after the news broadcast when you told them about the increased patrols... Don't you see? It was the news broadcast that killed her. It was my fault. I don't follow, sir. You mentioned it this afternoon, that stupid slip of the tongue that I made when I said that Margaret and I were in our bedroom when the man ran from the Caldwell house. He must have thought she could identify him. That's the reason he came back. Not to steal anything but to silence her. [ Mark crying ] Yes, that is a possibility. The tragedy is, she never saw him. She couldn't identify him. You mustn't blame yourself, sir. He threw her in the pool. She drowned before I could reach her. He threw her in the pool? Are you sure of that, sir? Of course, I'm sure of it. I was a witness. Pete Hayley and I were in the helicopter and we saw the whole thing. Then you had the light on? L... I thought I saw something. It was kind of a gut feeling, I suppose. I told him to go back and to hover over the patio area. I switched on the lights, and there he was. The same man holding Margaret in his arms. Are you sure it was the same man? Well, assumedly... Yes, he was wearing the same clothes. I see. You must have a lot of those. What? Gut feelings. What are you talking about? Well, you had a gut feeling last night. I don't know what you're talking about. What do you mean? When you asked for me to report to the Caldwell house. Yes. I found out you asked for me when you first called in. I did. What I mean, sir, is that the burglar had never harmed anybody before, yet from your bedroom window when you called in, you asked for me. I was just trying to figure out how you knew that the woman was already dead. I didn't. Didn't know, obviously. Well, I... I did have some kind of a feeling. I sensed something was wrong. Well, the lights were on, for one thing. The man running from the house, the fact that Janice was there alone, I... You're a policeman, I don't have to explain these things. Yes, I know exactly what you feel. I've had that feeling many times. You know something is wrong, you just can't get a handle on it. All right, sir. I'm going to look around the house if it's all right with you. Maybe the man got careless. Columbo. [ Sniffling ] Yeah, go ahead. What's the matter, Columbo? You think he's hiding in the tub there?( Columbo) Just checkin'. Yeah? What did you find?( Columbo) Clean and dry. Clean and dry. Let me ask you somethin'. How do you figure this guy? I mean, to me, a burglar is like a hungry alley cat. He sneaks around after dark, but if he hears somethin', he runs. Haven't you ever heard of future shock? The world's going to hell with itself. Believe me, Columbo. Times have changed. Yeah. Maybe. But still. But still, you know what bothers me about the murder last night? You mean the Caldwell woman? Yeah. I, uh, I looked at her body. Right away I saw on her finger the biggest diamond ring I ever saw in my life. Now, I gotta ask myself this question. What kind of a burglar robs a house and leaves a ring like that on the victim's finger? So that's what's been buggin' you? You're something else. Don't you think we thought of that? It's a phony. The ring was phony? Solid glass. A piece of garbage. A pro would have spotted it a mile away, and this guy's a pro. Excuse me, one moment, will you? Yeah, I guess that explains it. See, here I am, I've been batting my brains out trying to figure out about that ring and you guys had it all the time. Glass. How do you like that? Listen, Doc, do me a favor. Would you? When you perform the autopsy, would you check something for me? This woman apparently drowned in the swimming pool, so when you check her lungs, see if there's any evidence of chlorine. There won't be. Chorine dissipates almost immediately in the human body. Anyway, the fluids would be masked by the effects of pulmonary edema. So, uh, does that mean that you couldn't tell if this woman drowned, say, in a bathtub... Sure, if the bathtub were full of gin. Well, check it anyway, would you? It's part of the job. [ Engine starting ] [ Buzzing ] Yes? All right, send him in. I hope I'm not disturbing you, sir. No, it's all right. Come in. This is none of my business. Stop me if I'm out of line, but nobody expected you to be at your desk today. I want to be here, Lieutenant. I want to keep working, keep my mind off... All right, let's see. Uh, here's, ahem, here's Lieutenant Duffy's report. There's no question, it's the Bel Air Burglar, all right. It's too bad he got away last night without a trace. Oh, and speaking of reports... That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I'm making terrific progress, but, you see, I don't think we should be looking for a burglar. What? No, sir. I think we should be looking for someone who made it seem like a burglary. What are you talking about, Columbo? Here, read Duffy's report. It shows very clearly it's the same man we've been looking for. I'm sure this is a very good report, sir, but there are a couple of things that don't add up. Like what? Oh, for one thing, the fingerprints. Come on, come on, Columbo, there were no fingerprints. That's what I mean, sir. You see, Mr. Caldwell left the house around 9: 00. He called his wife at 10: 30 from the bar at the club. This is what bothers me, sir. If Mrs. Caldwell spoke to her husband on the phone, why didn't she leave any fingerprints on the phone? Now that's strange, isn't it? The maid spent the whole day cleaning, she dusted everything. Including the phones. The phone in the upstairs bedroom, that's absolutely clean. The one downstairs has Mr. Caldwell's prints on it, but it doesn't have Mrs. Caldwell's prints. All right, what are you implying? That Caldwell never actually talked to his wife? Did it ever occur to you that maybe the burglar used the phone after she did and then wiped it clean? Occur to me that the burglar used the phone after and wiped it clean? Yeah. No, sir. Why not? Well, because the burglar had to wear gloves. You see, sir, There were no prints of his anywhere in the house. Now there's another thing that's very strange. Is this bothering you? No. Um... Excuse me. There's something else. The way this woman's body was dressed in that nightgown. She didn't do that. Somebody else dressed her in that nightgown. Is that a fact, Lieutenant? Or just some more of your fancy guesswork? Well, you see, sir, she was wearing a pale blue nightgown which she got from her closet. And you know something? There were no prints on the handle of the closet door either. I don't see what you're getting at. Unless you're trying to tell me that Caldwell killed his wife and then faked the whole thing? Oh, no, sir. No. I don't mean that at all. No, no. No. You see, Mrs. Caldwell, she had a habit whereby she would put her nightgown under the pillow every morning. I saw a pink nightgown under the pillow. So, of course, we know that Mrs. Caldwell would not have put on the blue nightgown. Now, here's what's interesting. Mr. Caldwell, he knew about the nightgown under the pillow. So if he had dressed his wife's body, that would be the first place that he would have looked. No, sir, we're looking for somebody else. We're looking for somebody... somebody who tried to make a murder look like a burglary. Like who, for instance? Well, sir, I don't like to speak badly of the dead, but, yesterday, your wife confirmed to me that Mrs. Caldwell was seeing other men. And you think it was one of them? Yes, sir. I think that's a possibility. All right, now listen to me, Lieutenant, you're wasting your time and my time and the department's time and it's gonna stop. Now, look, Columbo, you must understand that no one, no one wants this man caught any more than I do. Especially now. But we are looking for a burglar, a man who killed one woman out of fear, who killed another to silence her. You go on that basis and we're going to solve this case. Is that clear? You don't think that I have anything here? Lieutenant, nobody can be right all the time. Look for your burglar. There's the killer. [ Door closing ] Excuse me, uh, Mr. Wexler? He's inside with a customer for the moment. Oh, thank you. We can smoke here? Yes. May I help you, sir? No, thank you very much. No, I am waiting for Mr. Wexler. Mr. Wexler is servicing a client at the moment. If there's anything I can do... No, thank you. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. Do you happen to... Do you sell watchbands? Of course. I broke this a couple of weeks ago. I've been carrying it with me. This is a very good watch, only five years old. Waterproof and shockproof. Do you have something for that? Oh. Seven jewels. We have a large selection, sir, starting at$25. No, I don't want a watch, just the band. That is for just the band. No kidding. I think I'll do it some other time, thanks a lot. Oh, uh, Mr. Wexler is free now, if you'd care to see him. Thank you. Mr. Wexler?( Wexler) I'm Bruno Wexler, yes. Lieutenant Columbo. If you can spare a moment, it's about Mrs. Caldwell. I believe she shopped here in your store. Mrs. Caldwell was a valued client, yes. Yes. That's what I understood, sir, from going through her papers. Mostly receipts for jewelry that she bought here. Of course, that was some time ago. The most recent receipt that I found was dated six months ago, September. Well, I would have to check back. Um, of course, she came in here quite a few times since then, didn't she? I mean, even though she didn't buy anything. I've talked to a few people, friends, the maid... Lieutenant, could you get to the point? May I sit down? Of course. This is the point, sir. Yes? It's glass. I can see that it's glass. But this appraisal for$8, 000 for a 3. 6- Carat, pear- shaped diamond ring with tapered baguettes in a four- prong setting. This appraisal is for that ring, isn't it? Well, I never would have charged Mrs. Caldwell$8, 000 for a piece of glass. But that is your work, isn't it? Yes, Lieutenant. I arranged with a friend to have this copied for Mrs. Caldwell so that her husband wouldn't realize that she had sold the original back to me. As a matter of fact, she sold a lot of jewelry back to you. The woman needed money. Her husband had cut off her funds. Then all the jewelry in her house was phony. Almost all of it. Yes. Why did she need the money? Really, Lieutenant... I understood she had a lot of boyfriends. Well, Mrs. Caldwell was beautiful and charming for a woman of 36. But she fancied that she was growing old very slowly. In fact, hardly at all to judge by the young men from whom she found companionship. Yes, indeed. That's a real honey. You know, we don't get to see many of these around anymore. Especially in this condition. Well, I try to take good care of it. I'm looking for a Mr. Shoup. I'm Mr. Shoup. Charlie Shoup. My name is Columbo. How many miles you got on it, Mr. Columbo? 20, 000? 30, 000 tops. Oh, I got over 100, 000 miles on this car. 100, 000? That's pretty hard to believe. Well, look, I don't care what the speedometer says, I'm gonna make you an offer on a trade- in that you just won't be able to turn down. Police? Look, I just work here. The stuff they pull up in the business office is none of my doing. You got a beef? Go see the boss. Good- lookin' watch. Thanks. I'm here to talk about a Janice Caldwell. Did she give you that watch? Janice Caldwell was a friend of mine, Lieutenant. Where were you Tuesday evening, Mr. Shoup, between 9: 00 and midnight? That was the night Janice was killed? Tuesday evening. I was right here until 9: 30, that's when we close up. As a matter of fact, Janice was supposed to pick me up. When she didn't show up, I gave her a call at her place, but there was no answer. Figured I'd been stood up. So I... There was no answer? No, sir. What time? Around 9: 30. Go on. Well, like I said, I figured I'd been stood up. So I went out with a little bookkeeper we got here, had a couple of drinks across the street, went back to my place. You can substantiate that? She's right inside, Lieutenant. Ask for Shirley. That won't be necessary. Thank you very much. You've been very helpful. Lieutenant? I'll give you$80 for it in a trade. [ Doorbell ringing ] Excuse me, Commissioner. I'm sorry to bother you at home... It's all right. Come in, Lieutenant. Thank you, sir. I know I was supposed to have the report at 6: 00. Let me tell you what happened. My car let me down again. They let me use another one. Well? Well, what? Where is it, the report? That's the problem. I sat down in front of the typewriter and nothing happened. Absolutely nothing. Look, Columbo, I'm a little bit tired. If you've come in here to bombard me with more of your screwball ideas... May I explain the problem, sir? Just give me a moment. You've had a lot of experience. You happen to know this woman Mrs. Caldwell. She was your neighbor. I thought maybe you could help me out with this thing. I'm trying to figure it out. If you could just give me a moment. All right. Come on. Thank you, sir. You want a cognac? No, thank you very much, sir. I want to keep my head clear. This is complicated. See whether or not you can help me with this. Janice Caldwell died between 10: 30 and 11: 00. Sometime after her husband spoke to her at 10: 30 and sometime before you saw the burglar run out at 11: 00. Right? That's correct. That's why I can't start the report. Why? I get stuck in the beginning, the time of death. What are you talking about, Columbo? Janice Caldwell had a boyfriend. She was supposed to meet him at 9: 30. That's an hour before she was supposed to have died. She never showed up. So she stood him up. So what? Yeah, but the guy called her around 9: 30, too, and there was no answer on the telephone. I have to ask myself the question, why couldn't she answer the phone? You know what I wrote down?\" Maybe she was dead already.\" You follow my thinking? Maybe she just didn't want to talk to the man. Did that occur to you? But she answered the phone later, when her husband called. You see the contradiction. If she didn't want to speak to her boyfriend at 9: 30, why did she pick up the phone at 10: 30? But did she pick up the phone at 10: 30? Because her fingerprints were not on the telephone. You see how confusing it gets. That's why I keep going back to this.\" Maybe she was dead already.\"' Cause if she's dead already, that explains everything. That explains why she doesn't pick up her boyfriend. That explains why she doesn't answer the phone. And it explains why her fingerprints aren't on the phone. Because if she was dead, her husband never spoke to her. It was a fake call. I specifically asked you this afternoon if you thought Caldwell had killed his wife. And you said no, for what I thought was a very good reason. Because he knew about the folded nightgown under the pillow. I did say that, sir. But in the light of these new developments, it occurred to me maybe he had an accomplice. Listen, why couldn't he go out and hire somebody to run out of the house at 11: 00, pretend to be a burglar. Provide him with an alibi. [ Snickering ] I see. I get it. The next thing, I suppose, that you're gonna ask me to believe is this phantom accomplice, who never killed anybody in the first place, of course, comes back the next night to kill my wife. Is that right? Is that the next step? You know, Columbo, I really... I really do admire your enthusiasm. The force could use a 100 like you. But this theory is a crock.( Columbo) You think so, sir? We are looking for a murderer who was a burglar, who panicked and killed two women. Now, that's the theory we're gonna go on. Is that clear? That's an order. Yes, sir. All right. Tomorrow morning, I want you to report to Lt. Duffy in the Robbery Division. I want you to concentrate on his leads. A little legwork and we'll have this man in a week, I promise you. The burglar? Sir, in that connection, I, uh, I spoke to a Mr. Wexler today... Well, you're tired... Not important. Good night, sir. Good night. This is 194. Can you patch me through? Doc, you wanted to talk to me? Uh- huh. Yeah? Say that again, Doc. Find out what happened to Frankie Vale. Yes, sir. Tell that probation guy I want to see him by this afternoon. Yes, sir.( Columbo) Lieutenant Duffy. Oh, Columbo. I'm having some problems. Thought you would. I spoke to the Commissioner last night. He suggested that I report to you and maybe we could work together. Well, it's nice to hear you have a little faith in us. Come on inside, Columbo. [ Typewriters clacking ] I thought maybe you could give me a line on some of the guys that you spoke to. You know, the most likely suspects. Take your pick. But I'll tell you something, you won't find him in there. You sure? Columbo, these guys are like old friends. Very placid and predictable types. Now, what we're looking for is a younger guy, a guy with a violent temper. Let me ask you something. Leave out the last two murders. Just concentrate on the first three robberies. If you had your choice, which of these guys would you pick? That's easy. The guy on top. Artie Jessup. Artie's always my first choice when he's out on the streets, which isn't too often. Take a look for yourself. In and out of the joint since he was 20 years old. That's almost 30 years of state hospitality, give or take a few vacations on the outside. You know, I think old Artie prefers prison life. He's very nervous out here with us civilians. What about the M. O? Fits a lot of guys, including Artie. We've already talked to him. We can't hold him. Why not? Columbo, you said forget about the murders, right? Artie has an alibi for both nights. Mr. Jessup? Do I know you? I stopped by your place. Your wife told me you were here. My what? My wife. You got Scotch? Yes, sir. You like Scotch? She wishes. Give him some Scotch. Thought maybe you could help me. Suppose I wanted a few dollars for that. Where did you find it, in a box of Cracker Jacks? [ Clearing throat ] It's not real. Come on, pal, what is this, some kind of hustle? A cop. I must be getting old. I'm not from Robbery. I'm from Homicide. I'm investigating the killing of those two women in Bel Air. Oh, no. Oh, no. You're not going to hang that one on me. No way! No way! Where's my jacket? You wanna book me, go ahead, book me! Where's my jacket? You had nothin' to do with it. Then what are you here for? I had nothing to do with it. You wanna know what I am here for? Yeah. Gimme this. Sit down. I don't wanna sit down. May I sit down? Go ahead. You had nothing to do with it. Now, the guys down at the Robbery detail they can't identify the burglar that committed those two murders. That's what I'm here for. I can't help you. You haven't heard anything? Nothing. You're sure? Do you know I'm afraid of Siamese cats? One meow and I'm out of the door with my pockets empty. Oh, look, Lieutenant, that guy who killed those women, he scares me. I mean, he really scares me. Look, I'm a professional, we both know that, right? Otherwise you wouldn't be down here. That guy what killed those women, he gives guys like me a bad name. Right. Look, Lieutenant, if I knew who that guy was, you think I wouldn't have called you guys a long time ago? Right. Would you rob a thing like this? Are you kidding? They'd laugh me off the cellblock. All right, listen to me, Artie. I got a problem. You can help me. Me? I think I know who killed those two women. But I can't prove it.( man) Hey, Artie, it's your old lady. She says, get your tail home, you're taking her shoppin'. Tell that bag to go... Tell her I'll be home in a little while. You know who killed those women? Come on, Hugh, make sense. Who wants money? The man. The burglar. The one who's been robbing all the houses around here. That's ridiculous. Mark, he's dead serious. He's ready to go to the police if I don't pay him. But how does he know you killed Janice?( Hugh) I don't know. I don't know. The point is that he knows. I should've called the police the moment it happened. You did call the police, my friend. How much does he want? I don't know. I don't know. Said he'd tell me later today. When are you supposed to meet him? Uh, 4: 30. A bar at Fifth and Wall. All right, meet him. I'll be waiting nearby. Find out what he wants, and we'll decide how to... how to deal with him. All right, no violence. Why, Hugh, I'm no more violent than you are. The cops are trying to pin those robberies on me. But, you see, I didn't pull that job in your joint. But I figure you know that already, don't you? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't hand me that. I figure you killed your old lady and tried to pin it on me. Well, I got news for you, pal, nobody makes Artie Jessup a patsy, you got it? It's gonna cost you. You still haven't given me proof. I don't need any proof. All I gotta do is go to cops and confess to those first three robberies and, you know what, all of a sudden, they look into the other two where the women were killed. Now, what do you think? I think they got you. Hey, I don't mind one way or the other. Bein' on the outside isn't all that great. All my buddies are back there, so going back on a burglary rap, I won't mind that a bit. Now, come on. What's it going to be, pal? Do I go to the cops, or do we work something out? All right. How much? Good. Well? He wants$5, 000 in small bills. Old money. Nothing larger than a$50.$5, 000, is that all? The man has no imagination. When do you meet him? Tomorrow afternoon, here. Same time? Right. Now, Mark, he's dead serious. He says he knows your department has him under suspicion for those other robberies, but that they can't prove anything. He's not a stupid man. All right, now, I want you to get the money from the bank. I want you to be here tomorrow at the same time. Mark, we can't start paying him. He's just gonna want more. Just leave him to me. You keep your mouth shut and don't admit to anything. We're gonna be just fine. Both of us. Oh, Columbo. What are you doing here? Oh, good morning, sir. Good morning. Lt. Duffy is out on call. I'm using his office. What's the matter with your office? Well, I was going through these file folders. These are the prime suspects in the robberies and Duffy didn't want the folders out of his office. I wanna tell you something. I'm doing it just exactly the way you suggested. I'm concentrating my efforts on the robbery aspects of this crime, and you're right. I think the answer lies right in here somewhere. Good. Good. Okay, well, maybe I'll take a glance at these myself again. I didn't get a very good look at that man the night he ran from the Caldwell house. Still you never know, do you? That's a good thought. Sometimes something just clicks into place. [ Mark clicking tongue ] Well, on the other hand, I've been through these a dozen times. I don't think they can help me any. That's a good thought, too, sir. No sense wasting your time on a dead end.( Mark) You keep at it, though, huh? If you come up with anything, let me know. [ Billiard balls striking ] Do you, uh... Do you mind? Be my guest. Easy. Easy. Under the table. Gonna count it? I trust you. If it's short, you can always make it up in the next payment. The next payment? You said... I said a lot of things, Mr. Caldwell. One thing I forgot to tell you was that... I'm a chronic liar.( Duffy) Sure they're in there, sir? Positive. Caldwell is meeting him on my instructions. Catch this man Jessup with the money, we'll have our killer.( Duffy) Okay?( policeman) Okay. All right. Move.( Artie) Take it easy.( officer) You want it the hard way?( Artie) Take it easy! What are you trying to do, break my head? What is this?( Mark) It's called blackmail, Jessup. First you rob this man's house, you kill two women, then you've got the gall to try blackmail. Get out! You don't have any proof. We'll have it. As soon as we search your apartment. Which we'll do right now. Columbo, Duffy, come with me. We'll need one squad car. Commissioner, we need a warrant before we can search that apartment. We already got one. You want to check it? Yes, sir, that's fine. I think you're making a mistake. I'll prove to you, I'm not. All right, take this man down and book him. Mr. Caldwell will give you his statement. Let's go. Commissioner, I believe you are making a mistake here, sir. Sir. I don't believe Jessup killed either of these women, particularly your wife.( Mark) Don't be ridiculous. I saw it, he threw her in the pool. There were other witnesses.( Duffy) Could you bring the keys up, please? Right away, huh? Sir.( Duffy) He's on his way up, Commissioner. Thank you. Sir, I realize that your wife appeared to die in the pool. Actually she died in the bathtub. What are you talking about? Right this way, please. Right this way. Room 13. It was the water in her lungs. Commissioner. The water in her lungs. There were traces of soap. Duffy, check that bathroom. You, get the kitchen. You see, sir, as soon as I saw the body, I knew right away something was wrong. You did, huh? Check behind that stove, get under the sink there. I knew something was wrong because of her outfit. What she was wearing, the tear in her dress. You see, I had asked myself the question. Why does a woman go to an important testimonial dinner knowing that her sleeve is torn? Got a whole closet full of nice clothes. The one thing that I knew, she was not on her way to the dinner when she was drowned. So, now it follows, she must have been drowned earlier. Now I find out about the soap. That places it in the bathtub. You see, a couple of hours before her body was dropped into the pool, somebody drowned her and somebody dressed her. The Medical Examiner's report set the time of death at 7: 30, Columbo. Yes, sir. But that was based on your eyewitness testimony. Now, I spoke to him. He said it could just as easily have happened a couple of hours earlier. All right. Suppose she did die in the bathtub. Jessup surprised and killed her. He dressed the body and threw it in the pool to make it look accidental. No, sir, that's not possible. You know why? You see, the bathroom, the bathtub, the faucet itself, everything was bone dry. Including the towels, not even slightly moist. That was the first thing I checked, sir. Now, she had to have drowned before 6: 00 maybe even before 5: 00, otherwise it wouldn't have been that dry. Long before Jessup got there. As a matter of fact, just about the time that you came home for supper. Commissioner. I believe you killed your wife. And I believe you either killed Janice Caldwell or you're covering up for it. You just lost your badge, my friend. Come on, come on, keep digging.( Duffy) Yes, sir. At first, I thought Mr. Caldwell was responsible, but that didn't work out because of the nightgown business. And then the next night when your wife was killed, and you had that terrific alibi, it suddenly hit me. You were in it together and you tried to blame Artie Jessup. And the truth is that Jessup was nowhere near either house either night.( Duffy) Commissioner. He wasn't, huh? All right, how do you explain these? Janice Caldwell's jewels. I can explain it. You took them from the Caldwell house, you hid'em, and today you planted'em here to incriminate Mr. Jessup. You're crazy, you can't prove anything like that. Sgt. Randall?( Randall) Here, sir. You. Commissioner Halperin says he found these jewels under your mattress. [ Snickers ] That's crazy. You're a liar. Hey, I don't even live here. What? I can verify that, sir. He doesn't live here. I live here. These are my shirts. That's my underwear. My brother- in- law. That's my nephew, my niece. I haven't lived here long. Just moved in. You see, the apartment was vacant for three weeks. I just signed the lease. You looked in the closet. Those were my pajamas and my bathrobe. The file folder, the... the report on the desk. Yes, sir, I'll have to take responsibility for that. You see, I persuaded Mr. Jessup to telephone Mr. Caldwell, knowing that Caldwell would contact you. I was sure that once you knew the true identity of the burglar, you'd try and incriminate him. So this morning, very early, just after I signed the lease, I made up a new file folder on Mr. Jessup. Everything was the same except this address. Only one person, beside myself, knew this address. That was you, sir. That's all. I think once your friend, Mr. Caldwell, understands the situation, he'll fill in some missing pieces", "imdb_url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233755", "imdb_id": "tt0233755", "year": "1906", "rated ": "N/A", "genre": "Comedy, Short", "plot": "N/A", "language": "English", "country": "USA", "poster": "N/A", "imdbRating": "N/A", "type": "movie"}

Then a wild mob pursues Anton, but the athletic barber makes his escape by jumping from the fast going vehicle. After running a short distance he sees a Zeppelin airship about to sail away.

He is scarcely seated in a quiet corner when a hideous, shriveled-up old man taps him upon the shoulder and whispers vaguely of a big inheritance for Prague's finest swordsman and wildest student if he will enter into a certain agreement. Balduin rebuffs him, satirically asking his weird companion to procure him \"the luckiest ticket in a lottery or a doweried wife.\" The old man goes off chuckling and thence onward persistently shadows Balduin, exerting a sinister influence over him, while Balduin is still disconsolate under the frowns of fortune. The Countess Margit Schwarzenberg, hunting with her cousin, to whom her father has betrothed her, meets with an accident. She is thrown over her horse's head into a river, but Balduin, who has been directed to the spot by his evil genius, plunges in and rescues her. Subsequently Balduin calls to inquire as to her condition at the castle of her father, the count, but be makes a hurried departure when Baron Waldis arrives, the contrast in their appearance discrediting him. His desire to win the countess and to humiliate the baron becomes so pronounced that he readily accedes to the compact suggested by Scapinelli, the old man, who has so pertinaciously dogged his footsteps, particularly when he learns that untold wealth and power will be his when he assigns to the other the right to take from his room whatever he chooses for his own use as he desires. The agreement is signed. Balduin receives a shower of gold and notes as his portion; Scapinelli takes Balduin's soul exposed in concrete form by his shadow. Balduin prosecutes his love affair assiduously and with apparent success, till the baron is informed of it by a jealous gypsy girl. He challenges Balduin to a duel, and the latter, assured of his superiority as a fencer, readily agrees. Count Schwarzenberg learns of the impending duel and appeals to Balduin not to kill \"my sister's child, my daughter's future husband, and my heir.\" Balduin gives his promise, but when he goes to the venue of the duel he meets, his own counterpart stalking away derisively wiping his gory sword on his cloak. Balduin turns and in the far distance sees the dying victim of the deed he swore he would not do. He rushes from the spot horror-stricken. When he regains sufficient composure he makes his way to the castle of the count, but is refused admission. Determined to explain that he had no complicity in the death of the baron, Balduin climbs into a room in which the countess is seated. She receives him coldly, but soon succumbs to his ardent wooing. Just as he seeks to leave her she notices he has no shadow and that the mirror gives no reflection of him; and she drops back affrighted, the ghastly apparition of himself which takes shape in the corner of the room sends Balduin scuttling away from the castle in a paroxysm of terror. He makes a frenzied flight through a woodland estate and the streets of Prague, but wherever he stops to recover his breath he is haunted by the counterpart of himself. He reaches his rooms and draws a murderous looking fire-arm from its case.

Not content with settling down to a quiet domestic life, he persuades Sari and his good crew to aid him in finding this white elephant. In the Royal Square of the Capitol of Siam, he reviews the troops which are all comprised of women, which is the custom there. The Prime Minister bids Zingo and his men to visit the Royal Harem. Here they are captured by the troops and are about to be tortured to death when Sari, disguised as a colonel in the army, aids them in escaping. They find the province of Chokuff where the white elephant has been secreted, and catching the Prince making love to Sari, they demand the white elephant. He promises, but traps them all in his dungeon. They are all, but Zingo, placed in barrels with their heads protruding. Zingo files away the bars of his cage, and rolls the barrels by the guards, who are in a stupor from opium smoking. He swims down the river, towing his crew in the barrels. After a fierce encounter with the Prince of Chokuff's army, he attacks the Royal barge in the Blud River, and after a bitter struggle in which he disposes of the entire crew by throwing them overboard, he captures the white elephant and recovers his faithful Sari. He returns the sacred elephant to the King of Siam, and after a big reception by royalty and the populace, Zingo is awarded rich treasures for his noble work.Episode 3: \"Zingo in Africa\" After returning from Asia with his jolly band of tars, laden with gold and precious stones as a reward for his clever work in recovering the Sacred White Elephant of Siam, Zingo thought he would never again feel the call of the sea, and he didn't for several months. But the wanderlust fever soon returned, and taking his wife as his sole companion, he set out for the wilds of Africa in search of fresh adventures. From this point on, let us follow Zingo down the Nile, and record his hairbreadth escapes. Selecting a likely spot, Zingo and Sari, his wife, make camp. Hearing piercing shrieks just back of their tent, they don bear skins and hasten to the spot in time to prevent the execution of two beautiful native girls by a band of savages. The two girls now become members of Zingo's party, happy to serve their gallant protector. The next day Zingo puts on his armored hunting suit to battle with hungry lions, who have been prowling about the camp. After an hour's terrific struggle with a pair of lions, Zingo returns to find his party gone, and many evidences of a struggle. Suspecting that they have been kidnapped by roving gorillas, Zingo sets off through the forest and eventually comes to the bottom of a large tree sheltering the crudely made gorilla nest. Having a smattering of monkey chatter, he quickly gains an entrance to the nest, and there discovers his wife and the girls more frightened than harmed. The good-natured gorillas listen attentively while Zingo explains that they must proceed up the Nile in their power boat, and they bid the party an affectionate farewell. During an inspection of the Pyramids, Zingo and his party encounter some knavish artists, who drug him and make love to Sari and the native girls. Zingo is boxed up and sold to a London professor as a rare specimen, and does not regain his senses until weeks later. After startling the assembled professors out of their wits, he charters an aeroplane and flies back to Egypt overnight in time to punish the cringing artists and save Sari and her servants from further insult. Then with a last fond look down the Nile River, Zingo and his party board the aeroplane and sail back to Paris.Episode 4: \"Zingo's War in the Clouds\" Zingo, while working and studying over the prospectus of the Eldorado Mine in his library in Paris, is visited by his faithful crew, who are restless from lying in port and beg of him to put to sea in search of new adventures.

In order to study the country around the mines, Zingo and his wife, Sari, erect huts in a nearby river to live in.

MAlN CHARACTERS THE FlRST PART Julius Caesar finds Servilia, the kindest and youngest of the powerful Cato family More pleasant than the noisy party of young people... The insouciance of youth takes completely for granted the entertainment...... and the enjoyment of love. A few months later The strict discipline that prevails in Servilia\u2019 s family is the reason that Julius can only see his beloved under cover of darkness. Servilia goes with Julius to the temple of the goddess Hera, protector of marital fidelity. Before the altar of the goddess, they take vows of eternal fidelity, and their secret marriage is blessed by a priest. Lutatius, head of the Cato family, which also includes Servilia, has, however, promised her to Marcus Brutus as a wife. Julius is seen as he leaves the house of the beautiful Servilia. The secret visits are reported to Lutatius. Lutatius, knowing of the relationship between Julius and Servilia, wants to speed up the marriage between Servilia and Marcus Brutus.\" You will marry Marcus Brutus... If you refuse, then the powerful dictator, Sulla, who is on our side... will ensure that Julius Caesar is sentenced to death.\"\" Stop... I agree!\" The last meeting. At the news of what is about to happen to his beloved, Julius decides to end his own life.\" It's not for me... think of our son!... Yes... I have to live for our son!\" Goodbye, Servilia! I swear that I will keep our secret until death. Also, our son will never know who his father was. Servilia married Marcus Brutus. At the wedding, she hides her pain behind a smile of pride. Confession.... I am a mother! Kill me if you wish, you have a right to do so... Our family knows how to die!\" No!... Live with your shame!... That will be your punishment!...\u201c\u201c It will be an honor for me to bear it.\" To avoid any suspicions by Marcus Brutus, Julius married the noble Cornelia. But neither family happiness, nor the birth of his daughter, Julia, made him forget his pain. The Romans were wary of the tyrant and dictator Sulla.\" Be on guard, Julius, for the dictator Sulla.\u201c\u201c This, unfortunately, could cost you your life.\"\" Are you here, Julius?\u201d\u201c Know that your presence here is very unwelcome...\u201d...\" But, Dictator, I am a citizen of Rome...\u201d\" Remember, Julius, that to contradict and oppose my will means death...\u201d\" Julius, only the intercession of the Vestal Virgins has saved your life.\u201d Despite the protection of the Vestal Virgins, Cornelia, wife of Julius, fearing the wrath of the dictator, urges her husband to flee before it is too late. Julius to Servilia. Abandon Rome, but do not run. Sulla remains very powerful. Our son must live. Farewell, Rome!... Capital of the eternal kingdom!... Today I leave your gates behind, but my enemies will tremble upon my return! During the seven years of Julius\u2019 s voluntary exile in Asia, Brutus, the young son of Servilia and Julius, receives his first lessons as a member of the Cato family, and the child gets into his head the idea that Rome should remain a republic. Little by little, the idea in the young Brutus grows to hatred of his unknown father, Julius, who was not a follower of the Republican Party. His mother, Servilia, tried persuasion to moderate Brutus\u2019 s hate against Julius. For her promise to Gaius, she had to hide her secret and not tell her son who his father was. The death of the dictator Sulla( in 78 BC) brings an end to his terror, and joy to a large part of the Roman people. Upon the news of the death of dictator, Julius decides to return to Rome after an absence of seven years. Julius has developed his own powerful voice, while in Asia, in his hometown. His plans have solidified. Rome trembles. Rome has its hopes on him. Julius knows he must win all the people with his kindness. He receives a visit from Tertullian, the wife of the rich and powerful Crassus. Julius, you will be surprised. Tertullian has come to visit. For a long time she has been interested in your efforts and your work. At the home of Tertullian, the wife of Crassus, where the friends and supporters of Gaius Julius meet for his election as consul. In the competition for the Senate seat, there were noisy debates between the supporters of Cato\u2019 s Republican Party and the followers of Julius. Julius, how dare you oppose the will of the Senate? Don\u2019 t you fear being called an enemy of the Republic? If you are an honest man, show that you have received notice.\" Take... read!... And see how Julius acts.\" Cicero to Julius\" Many have already won for our part, But beware the character of the intransigent Cato and his party. God forbid that we should again have a tyrant like Sulla.\" Tertullian, who admires Julius, introduces him in her home to Pompey and other powerful and influential men. Julius tells Pompey of his great plans, i. e., his election as consul and control of the Roman legions. Now begins the glorious campaigns by Julius. One year later Tertullian is going on ahead to meet Julius, who is returning to Rome with his invincible legions from Iberia( Modern Spain) to be the first to greet him as a future consul. Although Cato, with his great eloquence, has argued against the election of Gaius Julius as consul...... nevertheless, he hailed the Senate the next day for making Julius consul. Ten years later Julius, who long cherished a plan to use the Roman legions to penetrate even into the land of the Gauls( Modern France and Belgium), enlisted Pompey to help win acceptance of this plan. He gave his last daughter, Julia, to Pompey as his wife. The glorious campaigns and how much Julius aided the interests of the Republic are minimized by Brutus\u2019 s teachers, who presented Julius as hostile to the Republic. Irmidia, a powerful Gallic Vestal Virgin, requests a hearing with Julius Caesar. Despite the precautions that Tertullian took, she intended to go to Caesar.\" Abandon your plans, oh Caesar!\u201d\u201c Because I predict that your trip to Gaul will cost many lives.\u201d More, perhaps, than even you suspect.\" Tertullian sacrifices herself for Caesar. She receives the murderous knife blade that was meant for him. The people give their luck to Caesar and his legions as they depart for the land of the Gauls and hope that they will also return as victors. Druids( Powerful priests and priestesses) make sacrifices to the gods and pray that they will protect the 38 Gallic tribes against domination by the Romans. Vercingetorix, king of the Arverni, is appointed supreme commander of the Gallic army. Irmidia, the powerful Gallic Vestal Virgin, is inconsolable, having failed in her attempt on the life of Caesar. She wants to cut off her arm, because it was too weak to bear the knife to kill him. You saved my arm. I will give my life for the fatherland! Alesia's siege by Roman legions. Gallic reinforcements arrive by a secret path. The city is besieged by the Romans. The commander orders the Gallic captains to send messengers to all the tribes to send aid to Alesia.

Guided by the heroic Camulogenes, the force approaches the edge of the fortifications erected by the Romans.\" Free Gaul commands you: Flee, Romans, or Caesar\u2019 s ambition will find its grave here!\" The Gauls are too few against the Roman legions, which are well trained in the art of war, and must retreat. Catapults wreak havoc among the Gauls Catapults wreak havoc among the Gauls. With great effort, the Gauls escape for a short time from the Roman warriors...... But in the end, they are captured and taken before Caesar. The Gauls vainly seek refuge in Alesia...... but the fortress is in the hands of the Romans by nightfall. After the defeat of the Gauls. Conquerors and conquered. Friends and opponents of Caesar meet in the\" Curia Hostilia\"( Meeting of the Senate) news of the desperate struggle of the Gauls. We bring good news! Posts tell of the victory of the great Caesar. VERClNGETORlX IS A PRlSONER OF CAESAR. The Roman eagle now rules all of Gaul. The glorious victories inflamed hatred between members of the Republican Party of Cato and the supporters of Julius Caesar. Most Senate members vote to deprive Caesar of his status as consul. The eloquent arguments by Curio, a supporter of Caesar, are in vain. Cato's party is too strong. Marc Anthony, Curio and other supporters of Julius Caesar leave after being ejected by the\" Curia Hostilia.\" In Ravenna, Marc Anthony and his friends hear the news of the hostile attitude of the Senate to Caesar. The next morning, the delegates send Senate officials to the camp. The spokesman is Brutus, who does not know that Caesar is his father and sees in him only a powerful opponent of the Republican Party. Hail, Gaius Julius Caesar You are ordered to dissolve your legions and surrender the title of consul. My legions will themselves respond to the Senate...... And do not be afraid... Your life is sacred to me. Caesar made known to his captains the message from the Senate. Hail, Gaius Julius Caesar You are ordered to dissolve your legions and surrender the title of consul. The leaders, who knew Brutus was against Caesar, played with dice as to which one of them would kill Brutus. However, the watchful father loves his son's life and protects Brutus. Stop!... Do not go out with a dagger in the dark. I will not tolerate murderers among my men! This life is sacred to me. Do not expect me to thank you! I will despise them all my life, as they are enemies of the Republic. Caesar's legions retire to the river Rubicon.( The Rubicon is considered to be the boundary of Italy) The big event of Roman history. Romans marching on Rome!\" Alea boasts est!\u201d( The die is cast!) The Roman eagle moves against its own country. In Rome there was great commotion about the progress of Julius Caesar and his legions. Always forward! With great fear the Senate decides to place Julius Caesar outside the law. With fear and joy, Julius Caesar is acclaimed by the Roman people. Not servitude!... Not slavery!... My invincible eagle will provide glory and freedom. Without listening to the words of the temple guardians, Caesar profanes the temple of Saturn, and takes the treasure to provide food for his troops. Without listening to the words of the temple guardians, Caesar profanes the temple of Saturn, and takes the treasure to provide food for his troops. Caesar, stop!... You are defiling the temple!... The treasure is inviolable! Saus populi suprema lex!( The welfare of the people is the supreme law!) The enemies of Caesar left Rome. In addition, Julius Caesar's ally, Pompey, has joined the enemy. At Dyrrnachium( Durazzo in Albania), the first galleys arrive with Pompey's troops. The next day. Cato and Brutus blame Pompey, who was doubtful about Caesar. Caesar marches against Pompey's legions. Caesar gives the order to his captains to preserve the life of Brutus. At a sign from Caesar, hidden warriors appear. The camp of Pompey is completely surrounded. When the dawn tints the sky, the armies face off... Caesar, rich in ideas, orders a new battle plan, and advances his archers. Pompey follows the old methods and struggles to lead his troops in rows of lockstepped soldiers. Man against man! Romans against Romans! Pompey's troops struggle heroically...... but in vain. Again, the brave have to retreat. Pompey's army retreats in a disorderly flight. But even in the wild chase, Caesar\u2019 s commands are followed and Brutus is captured and brought before his as yet unknown father, Julius Caesar.\" I despise you! It is only due to the gods that you are the winner. Otherwise... Now I ask you to kill me.\"\" No. I want you to live for the homeland. Rule the Gauls that I have conquered! With so much grace, Brutus bows his head. The vanquished Pompey seeks refuge in Egypt. Caesar's eyes follow as Pompey's ship flees. Show Caesar Pompey's head, which was finally taken by King Ptolemy. The latter believes that he is doing a service to Caesar. Pompey!... I did not want your death! In Rome, the winner receives the highest honors, and offers a symbolic parade of his many victories. All Rome is now under the rule of Caesar, Who is appointed dictator for life. The hatred of the party grows even greater. A secret visit. To Marcus Brutus- Greetings! THE REPUBLlC OF ROME HAS SUFFERED THE TYRANNY OF THE DlCTATOR TOO LONG, AND CANNOT BEAR THlS SlTUATlON ANY LONGER. THE REPUBLlC IS IN DANGER!... BRUTUS, ARE YOU SLEEPlNG?... ARE YOU NOT STlLL BRUTUS? A FEW DAYS LATER Brutus returns to be fully influenced Casio's house is the head of the conspirators. Caesar will be overthrown. Trust, however, to luck and throw all caution to the wind. Beware, great Caesar, the Ides of March( March 15) I am telling you what your loyal friend\u2019 s signal to the conspirators is. As someone puts his hand on the left shoulder of Caesar, it's time to end his life. So save the Senate from Caesar. I do not want members of the Senate to be watched by my soldiers as if they were enemies. The Ides of March( 15 March 44 BC)\" Remember, Caesar, the Ides of March have come.\" In the most terrible moments of his life, Julius Caesar does not see that he knows his enemies. Him...?! Ruunt fata! On one hand the domination of the world, on the other hand, his son.\" And you, too... my son Brutus?\" Next to the body of Caesar, Marc Anthony swears revenge. Servilia is worried by rumors in the street.\" I have killed Caesar... and I've saved the Republic from destruction!\" Brutus!... You wretch!... What have you done...? He was your father... At the funeral ceremony, Servilia bids her final farewell to Julius Caesar, who never stopped loving her. Marc Anthony reminds the crowd, with inspired words, of the great deeds and the merits of Caesar. Not dead in any battle, he was killed by a murderer! The enthusiasm of the crowd reaches its climax when Marc Anthony reads Caesar's will, which provides for the assets to be bequeathed to the people. The people avenge Caesar's murder. Now the murderers suffer the same fate they delivered to the greatest general and statesman of Rome. The fire that burns Caesar's body destroys only his body, not the fame of his glorious victories.

They are soon married despite the advice of their friends, who well know the bitter animosity existing between Sulla, dictator of Rome, and Lucius Cinna. The immediate result of this hasty marriage is an annulment and the banishment from Rome of Caesar. He leaves, vowing that the eternal city shall again hear of him. This does not occur until twenty years later, when he returns at news of Sulla's death and plunges briskly into the campaign for the consulship. In this he is aided by Calpurnia, daughter of the wealthy Piso. Caesar and Calpurnia are married and Caesar is elected to the consulship in the face of strong opposition by Cato, the younger, who fears the growing popularity of the still youthful statesman. To further fortify himself against the attacks of Cato, Caesar forms a political alliance with Pompey. which later grows into the first triumvirate consisting of Caesar, Pompey and Crassus. Caesar then gives his daughter Julia, by his first wife Cornelia, in marriage to Pompey and turns his restless ambition to greater fields. News that he will set out with an expeditionary force into Western Europe brings a strong protest from the Gauls. One day a beautiful Druidess visits Caesar and attempts to end his life, thwarted only by the ever-watchful, loving eye of Calpurnia. Not in the least daunted, Caesar pushes his campaign into Gaul with characteristic vigor, sweeps to destruction the formidable tribes headed by Vercingetorix in a series of the most brilliant battles recorded in history. and returns triumphant to Rome. Meanwhile. Pompey grows jealous of the conqueror's ever increasing power and stirs up the senate against him. citing the Roman law that no man may become proconsul and retain military command. Marc Antony warns Caesar, at Ravenna, of what he may expect in Rome while Marcus Brutus, nephew of Cato, visits Caesar with the senate's dictum. And Caesar, placing the matter squarely before his soldiers and receiving their answer, \"Without Caesar there is no Rome,\" orders his troops across the Rubicon. The senate declares him a traitor, but the populace hails him with acclaim and ceremony. Then the struggle for the mastery of the world begins. Caesar robs the Temple of Saturn to secure money for his troops and pursues Pompey to Pharsalus. where a desperate battle takes place, resulting in the annihilation of Pompey's army and the flight of its leader into Egypt. Back to Home goes victorious Caesar to fight no more and to be made Dictator for life. In 44 B.C., Julius Caesar, now fifty-six years of age, settles down to the administration of justice with a temperance and wisdom mellowed by age and experience. But his old enemy, Cato, intent upon the Dictator's destruction, hatches a conspiracy in which he and Brutus are the ringleaders. When veiled rumors of this reach Caesar he refuses to affront the dignity of the senate with armed guards and one day permits the opening, long watched for by the conspirators. Brutus touches him upon the shoulder and the next second a knife flashes in the air. Caesar reels, the target of a dozen blows, \"And thou, too, Brutus. Then fall Caesar.\" Pandemonium reigns.

{"title": "Homunculus, 1. Teil", "content": "HOMUNCULUS from Robert Reinert's dramatic poem PROLOGUE Artistic direction: Otto Rippert Photography: Carl Hoffmann... and so, my illustrious colleagues, all my research and that of my friend Hansen to chemically create this artificial human being has failed miserably. Nature has its intangible limits. Life and Death are its inviolable secrets. No, professor- cries Hansen- still I am fired by this faith, and I will never, I repeat, never give in! The science laboratory for Hansen's research. Rodin is his trusted aide. A blessed event at Ortmann's house. Not of science, but of love: the smile of a baby in the cradle. The tenacity of Hansen has born fruit. A heartbeat, a cry: A Homunculus is born! The announcement for Ortmann. And his baby, that day, was suddenly taken sick. Hansen, who is invited to London for a conference on that great discovery that has so excited the world, entrusts the new born to the wise care of Professor Ortmann. Fate! The child of love, dies, whilst that of science lives! A criminal thought. At night, like a thief... Ah, disaster, disaster! The little one is dead. Ortmann confides his secret to his friend Steffens. Ah, how fleeting is my triumph! My dreams have crumbled... with the rapid decay of this little form which clings to life no more. Twenty- five years later. To all, Homunculus is the son of the late Professor Ortmann. And in school, Homunculus, without faith follows the lessons of Professor Hansen. In life... Men talk of love, But what is love? Twenty five years ago, on this very spot, I created a Homunculus. But the little one died almost immediately. His death was perhaps a blessing. Homunculus, outwardly perfect, but without love, deprived of all human feeling, would have gone through life as a terrible scourge of hate and destruction! Me too, I am also like Homunculus, without love, to hate, to destroy! Why am I so? In the tempest of his anguished doubt... I have treated and regarded you as my son, but you are not. The secret of your birth, exactly described, lies in a box I have consigned to my good friend Steffens. He will remove the seal to the document 25 years after my death and not before. Ortmann. I want to know it all! All! All! The horror!... Homunculus... This living monster, it is I! How I hate that man who gave me birth, from his mixtures and stills! From Hansen. The revealing document... You, you, Homunculus? You, son of my brain? You're alive... Alive! Let me touch you, you are my work! I hate you. Stand aside! Could you give me a soul? Could you give me tears? Could you give me a cry, so that I could cry\" Mamma, Mamma\"? HOMUNCULUS Part One A stray dog. Even you poor dog, wandering alone? But you fear me not. Breathe your warm breath on my hand. Will you be my companion and friend? Illiana, the daughter of Prince Desagra. What's wrong pilgrim? Why so sad? How can I help you? Not for me, but for my poor dog. If you stroke him, I will be grateful. Prince Desagra, paralyzed for many years. They have told me of a strange figure that roams outside the gates of the sacred city. If it is the Homunculus, of whom all the world talks with horror, crush him without mercy. Crossing valleys and mountains, Rodin follows the footsteps of Homunculus, but never finds him. Disconsolate, the doctors can do nothing to save their Prince. My father is dying. One day, you gave me a kind word. I will heal him, lead me to him. Arise! I command you! His willpower, created by science, has been able to perform this miracle. You have saved my life. Ask of me what you will. I can make you rich and happy. I ask for nothing. It is enough that one day you will not turn against me... Farewell... End of Part One HOMUNCULUS Part Two He possesses the infernal book. From these old pages he derives his superhuman power. Love sings in vain in the heart of illiana. The Prince has sent me. He wants to talk to you. The people accuse you of witchcraft. They want to know who you are. Explain! What do you care who I am? Here I do good things. What more do you want? It's the Homunculus! It's the Homunculus! Read! Read! Search again, search... Thieves!... My book!... Return to me my book!... Death to the Homunculus!... Death! One more step and I'll throw this book down. Rodin. Kill Homunculus! Kill the man who spreads terror throughout the world! Illiana's heart. Come... I will save you! Among the ruins of the old Moorish castle. Are you here Rodin? What do you want? Why do you seek me? Are you too with my enemies? I seek you because I love you, because in part, you are my work and I admire you. We are discovered! Flee! Kill him! Kill him! What do you want, murderers? Poor beast, you have paid for your devotion, with your life. You will remain forever in my memory. And Rodin still by his side, tragic shadow of a gloomy fate. Just one drop of this liquid could destroy a thousand lives at once. Awful flame, you are mine! You will obey me! That day... The look of this man is fixed in my soul like the cold blade of a knife. They talk of love... Ah, I would give all, all, including my revenge, for a single word that would let me feel love. I ask for the grace and compassion, for the alms of that word I know not. Flee from me, but you are still mine! I have decided, come! My gaze seeks you, come!... Your love will be for me a supreme attempt at renewal! His mouth as cold as death knows not how to kiss. Many days later. You have abandoned your home and your Enrico has killed himself! Leave this fatal man and return to us. We are old and infirm. Autumn leaves are falling, hearts too. Your mother has died of a broken heart. I am left alone in the old house. I am cursed! Cursed! Weeping! Is this the sorrow that brings tears? She loves me because she knows not who I am. But I want more. I want to be loved for who I am! The time has come to know the truth. The cot where I was born was a chemical laboratory. I owe my life to the whims of a scientist. I was the terrible product of mixtures and stills. I Homunculus! The spell is broken. Leave me. You revolt me. My hatred, indestructible, eternal! Only you are mine! Ah, my father, I am your daughter, look at me! I have returned to weep with you, to ask your forgiveness! Flower! Neither you nor I were born of man. Who would dare to curse you for it? You have extinguished in me the last flicker of hope! And I for you have lost all! Again the darkness.

Awful flames, you are my work. Destroy! In the pages of the old book, he can write his words of triumph.. Since that night, Xenia, fascinated, follows him like a dog. Leaden is the sky. What do you want, woman? Why do you follow me? I am your shadow because I love you. I adore you for your strength. I know who you are... You are Homunculus! You have violated my secret and you must die! For you I would die happy! The crowd is in a delirium of terrible passion. Death to the traitors!... Death!... Save yourself!... Flee!... They are searching for you!... Is it me you seek, madmen? Take me you fools, I am yours! Saved! Only you, hated creature, were devoted to me because I was Homunculus. Come...

Memories arise amidst the flames. All of the past in a handful of ashes! Where will he go?... What will he do? Why do I shake so? It is you that I fear! I am afraid! A final gesture, one last cry, and the man without love, created by a machine, plunges back into his nothingness. Behind these ruins, emerges the dawn of a new life.

Verga Directed by Piero Fosco [ Giovanni Pastrone ] A party at the Palazzo de Rancy Here is the Russian countess! She who drove her last lover to his death... You want me to introduce you to the Countess Natka? Gladly, but be careful. I won't be responsible! Giorgio La Ferlita, Attach\u00e9 to the Embassy. The Countess Natka Bolkonski. Every dance is reserved. But the high spirited Countess still offers her book.\" Crossed out\" is Major Guidoni, the famous swordsman. She made sure to know which of the two men had paid with his life as on a whim of the Roman circus? Dawn Convalescence I love you! I'm leaving, goodbye. The Countess didn't leave word of where she was going. She took the train for the south. But soon Giorgio had lost track... and returned with a certain Palmira. One day... and Giorgio thought no more of you... But a few days later... Come tonight. She will be there. But the evening was at an end and the amorous, budding Machiavelli, the fine diplomat... had drawn a blank. Why don't you show up any more? My permission? Granted, granted. Come Friday evening. Thos. Cook& Son Packaged Tour Itineraries Of course it wouldn't be advice if you followed it; but if a pleasure cruise doesn't appeal to you ask for a posting to the Embassy in Washington or Peking. Friday at Countess Natka's Giorgio, my friend, I'm beginning to suspect that you are cutting rather a ridiculous figure. Come on, head home... You no. Stay. Oh! What torture, to lie all evening... I've kept you because I know you're a tolerable pianist, and music will drive away my headache. Do you want to kill yourself? Half undressed in the cold night air. What does it matter to you! How cruel you are. We're alone at night. amid the rustling leaves and the pale light of the stars. If you could only see how beautiful you are!- Really?- How much I love you! Who? You? And the persistent laughter and convulsive coughing so shake her fragile body that she staggers and falls... Believe me. Go back. You'll kill yourself like this! And Natka is as docile and obedient as a little girl. And in the quiet warmth Natka finds comfort. I love you! I'm leaving, goodbye. Do you feel better? If I was courteous to you, be the same with me. Please write what I tell you as if you'd thought of it yourself, like a memory of this evening we've spent playing Romeo and Juliet. Write: I love you, I'm leaving, go... It's pointless because I already wrote it last time. You! You, then! How you know how to lie! Would you like me to be your lover? For me to give myself to you, tomorrow, tonight, coldly, deliberately? Without love? Would you like...? Oh? How I understand that one can kill oneself to escape your fatal charm! You who will kill yourself... You who love me as much as you say having a joyful ride with some happy girlie? I won't excuse you, now it's late... You must know! Sit down! I have loved... once. He was a rebel, a Polish student. The police sought him. He hated me because I was of the ruling class. There was an abyss between us... and dizziness overwhelmed us. My husband doesn't love me, He was away. Then returned. He knew. I had to follow him. Dolski not meeting me again searched for me He was deported! I knew. I thought I'd die... He was gone... I fled... I went on alone. And when at last, I reached him... I knew that he had had a DlSTRACTlON... like you! And like a mad thing I rode on and on... Even that man loved me, in his own way in the manner of you others... He broke the ban at the cost of his life. At that moment I couldn't forgive the man, who was killing me for not having the least self respect for his crime. And four days he remained so and four nights. and his wailing was like that of a lost dog. Pay him! Do it! It's fine! When I left the bed I was consumptive. He was dead, I was still dying. And that is love! Tell me at least... That which you wrote me... You thought of it then? Good night. The countess paid for her moonlight walk with a few days of fever. Giorgio no longer saw her. Countess, I know you are unwell and I am greatly distressed. First for the facts per se and then by wicked fate which has obliged me to leave without kissing your hand. By the orders of the Ministry, I must leave immediately for the Lisbon Embassy, my destination, and I am obliged to... I'm going to the theatre and I want you to accompany me? The opera Ruy Blas is in the first act. And the melody that wraps with magic strings the suffering heart of Natka. The famous duet of Act ill Oh, sweet delight Desire of gentle love The thunderous applause of the audience requesting an encore snapped the thread of melody... and her soul seemed to break! And so in the shadows, suddenly, without uttering a word... No. No I won't! I don't love you. I despise myself. The Count had arrived unexpectedly. I'll be ready to leave even tomorrow morning, Count. Giorgio, when we parted, neither you nor I knew that that would be our last goodbye. I have answered you and I would like to suffocate you in my arms, like a jealous tiger. I love you! I love you! And I will never see you again! I tell you this so you can lock these words away in your heart as I have locked your image away in mine. You know that little remains for me in this life! Goodbye Giorgio! I make you a promise! To come and die close to you! I want to cry in your lap! Natka I love you! I love you! And I will never see you again! I tell you this so you can lock these words away in your heart as I have locked your image away in mine. APPlGIONASI Time passes. Giorgio surrenders to the insistence of a rich merchant who wants him to marry his daughter. Hoping more easily to forget the woman loved Giorgio becomes engaged. Natka's promise: To come and die close to you. The loved voice calls, uselessly. Mr. La Ferlita cannot be found. Natka chooses to die at the Grand Hotel Theatre dell'Odeon. In a wing of the Hotel where Natka prepares to die, bustling with cosmopolitan life. Countess, I send you the drug you require. I must warn you that the wellbeing this provides is imaginary. This will not prolong life but cuts short the anticipation of it. However remember: no more than 3 drops in 24 hours. With respects, Doctor Rufsel. Natka for her Giorgio, will live in one hour the last days that remain of her life. And her cheeks, burn with sudden flame, and her lifeless eyes found their ancient splendor. Woe betide him if fate pushes him to open that door! That drink... more... a few drops more! And whilst the passionate tragedy burned in the neighbouring theatre the crowd applauded the dance of fire. Tell me, is she beautiful? Tell me! Did you love her as you loved me? Tell me. And she had in her voice something dark and fatal. And her body shook with fearsome convulsions, so that her very bones creaked. And rigid, she remains, cataleptic, almost dead. and little by little her beautiful body shrouded by the veil of death. The short circuit. The fire has almost reached the wing of the Grand Hotel. And in the splendour of the fiery sunset... Natka fervently in love with her beloved Giorgio miraculously feels herself return to youthfulness and life.

Conserved at the Cineteca Italiana of Milan A positive nitrate copy of the time, coloured, and with French captions, conserved at the Cin\u00e9mat\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise. Various non- filmic materials, among which, a brochure of the time discovered by Vittorio Martinelli. As with the negative, so the positive. Parts have suffered from decay. The original film of 08/ 11/ 1916 measured 1, 855 metres The present print measures 1, 770 metres. PROLOGUE( 1789) A reception at the house of Madame Vig\u00e9e- Lebrun The famous painter has just finished the portrait of her young friend the beautiful TERESlA, Marquise de Fontenay. The young printer Jean LAMBERT TALLlEN takes the page proof to the well- known journalist RlVAROL. A nobleman, to amuse himself at the young worker's expense asks him for his opinion on the painting and TALLlEN does not hide his thoughts It's a nice portrait but it's lifeless. The artist wasn't able to convey the ardour which is concealed under model's outward languor. Madam, I hope to meet you again when I become a man at whom you can't laugh anymore. Below, the revolutionary nimbus was radiating on the people. While the aristocracy forgets, in social frivolities, the gravity of the moment... A menacing echo comes up from the street... The fiery youth of Jean GUERY scorning with vehemence the popular fury seduces the burning and romantic heart of TERESlA. So as to avoid the turmoil in the capital The Marquis de Fontenay retires with his young wife to his rich country estate. Our guests have just arrived. On the outskirts of Paris, the revolutionary ferment is at its peak. An idyil of THEOCRlTUS on the scenography of WATTEAU. I married the Marquis without loving him; gambler and libertine, my husband didn't try anything to win my heart. While his guests surrender to innocent pastoral fantasies... The husband of the beautiful TERESlA is surprised while courting a housemaid. Publicly insulted TERESlA tells her husband that there is no longer anything in common between them. The revolutionary lightning has flared up. The storming of the Bastille END OF PROLOGUE 1793 Four years later TALLlEN Member of the Public Welfare Committee ROBESPlERRE The undisputed leader of the Revolution Dressed as a Sans- culotte THE UNSElZABLE, a counter- revolutionary gets into Robespierre's study. And... Once again Jean GUERY defies the guillotine. ROBESPlERRE enters. Envious of Tallien's popularity Robespierre sends him to Bordeaux to suppress the royalist reaction. TERESlA has obtained a divorce. Not feeling safe in Paris, she moves to Bordeaux. A letter foretells the immanent arrival of Jean GUERY who discovered the refuge of the woman he loves... Despite the risk he is taking, he wants to see you... The follower of The Terror, supporters of the Guillotine TALLlEN and the Government's commissioners arrive in Bordeaux. To exhibit his zeal for the Republic TALLlEN immediately signs the first arrests. How people made fun of the police in 1793... Caring not about death which threatens them closely JEAN and TERESlA think of nothing but their love. Tallien's condescending attitude provokes the first discontent among Robespierre's supporters especially DESFlEUX, the powerful Head of Police. Here are the enemies of the Republic whom you must sentence to the guillotine. TALLlEN, do you no longer remember us? These two men will remain under my protection Jean GUERY continues to defy DESFlEUX's policemen. ROBESPlERRE's officers accuse TALLlEN of provoking, with his weakness in taking measures, the audacious deeds of the Unseizable. Robespierre hates me. I know, and he has charged you to watch over me. Go tell him that the affront of this Jean Gu\u00e9ry will cause many heads to roll. Incited by the Unseizable the Royalists secretly organize a great conspiracy. The Unseizable! Dictator Tallien has chosen the charming laundress Vidaillon to embody the goddess of REASON at the revolutionary festival. Now you can run away from me no more. The Goddess' morning. The Goddess' reason immersed in wine. The Goddess of Reason is awaited. DESFlEUX leads his followers on The Unseizable's trail. The crowd heckles noisily under Teresia's windows. You have hidden a dangerous criminal, and will pay with the guillotine.... meanwhile TALLlEN was looking for a new Goddess of Reason. TERESlA, the woman who hid the Unseizable. Do you remember Vig\u00e9e- Lebrun's salon? My poor criticism of which you then made fun. I have never forgotten you. Here is the Unseizable. He? The Unseizable? That man is none other than my ex- husband, the Marquis de Fontenay, who had returned from America to see me. If you really wish me to be happy, free me from this importunate husband. Expel him, please! And have him vanish from my life! The impatient people rebel and, by destroying everything, invoke the Goddess of Reason whereas you enjoy being a gentleman with a... The sacrifice to the cult... The Goddess of Reason: HERE SHE COMES! The Goddess' triumphal chariot. The allegorical Temple of Reason. Two months later, TERESlA reigns supreme over TALLlEN'S heart and uses her influence to persuade him to clemency. She has already managed to save more than one head and so she receives requests from many royalists. If you love me, as you claim, save these wretched people. TALLlEN must rush to Paris to justify himself to Robespierre. The meeting at Caffe V\u00e9nus. It is better not to return to Bordeaux. Of what do you accuse me? I accuse you not. I give only advice. Madam. Jean GUERY asks after you. In order to quieten the suspicions of moderation hanging over him, Robespierre redoubles his ardour and increases the executions. Tallien, oppressed by Robespierre's secret hostility, confides his fears to Teresia, who encourages him to stand up to the Dictator. Ah, that's TERESlA, TALLlEN'S well- known friend. We will try to find out through her... A polite conversation which conceals a deadly duel. Join me. We shall rule France together.- No, I could never do it...- So, you hate me, citizen?- No, I do not hate you, but I fear you. The odour of the blood you shed frightens me. Reckless! This marks your sentence and Tallien's too.- TALLlEN, every day a new conspiracy, a new one for every reprieve you sign.- Give me the report and you'll see what my Clemency is. At Count Paroy's, the plotters. Attention! We are lost, my friends. Robespierre is my mortal enemy and I am certain he has followed me all the way. Defend your freedom with this dagger. TERESlA, you here?- Let go this woman. I'll take care of her.- Citizen, ROBESPlERRE'S order is strict. This woman too will have to go with us. Watch out! This woman's life is sacred. Woe betide you if you dare touch her. Tallien, shattered, obtains from Fouquier- Thionville, attorney general that his sentence be delayed by four days. At the Carmelites' prison. Love is stronger than death; Jean and Teresia think only of the sweetness of meeting again. The promise of Eternal Love The representatives' appeal to the grisly call. The Marquis de Fontenay- And I, TERESlA GABARRUS who has been arrested together with these gentlemen?- Your name is not on my list, citizen. Full of love, TERESlA'S generous heart, rebels at the idea that Jean will face his death alone. TALLlEN obtains, at high price, from the prison guard a secret visit to TERESlA.- Today's condemned have already been summoned.- When Robespierre, whom I insulted, doesn't find my name on the list he will write it himself. If you do not kill the tyrant tonight I shall be guillotined tomorrow. Swear that you will be mine and I swear to you I shall bring ROBESPlERRE down; or else die. TERESlA, with her heart in torment, loses her happiness for love of Jean. The Revolutionary Court On the threshold of my death, I assert my identity. I am Jean GUERY the one you call THE UNSElZABLE. The day before the clash of 9 Thermidor. TALLlEN prepares his closing speech. The historic session of the Convention when the Terror was supposed to subside. Robespierre's supporters are being ferociously opposed. Billaud is scaling the stand. The Jacobins are the ones who want to slaughter the Convention. It will die if it proves to be frail. Excitement is at its peak. The gallery rings with the cries:' Death to the traitors!'' Long live the Convention!' ROBESPlERRE feels the ground shaking under his feet.' I ask for permission to speak' SAlNT- JUST tries to overturn the outcome of the debate despite the rising hostility of the Assembly. TALLlEN, who senses the danger, once again prevents SAlNT- JUST from speaking. I speak to you, honest men, and not to that bunch of murderers. Free men, are you still willing to suffer the despotism of ROBESPlERRE? We must bring the tyrant down. TALLlEN'S flamboyant gesture electrifies the Assembly. From all sides, shouts which demand the arrest. ROBESPlERRE rushes to the stand. But the chairman, COLLOT d'ARBOlS, is unable to restore order. For the last time, chairman of the murderers, I ask permission to speak.- The Republic is lost. Brigands are triumphing. I... I...- It's DANTON'S blood that's choking you. Commit him for trial... Have him arrested... Before the court... Before the court. Hours go by, TERESlA'S anxiety increases. Robespierre, Couthon, Saint- Just, Le Bas with other followers have taken refuge at The H\u00f4tel de Ville.... while Henriot, leading of a group of town police tries to stir up the Sans- culottes to help the tyrant... BARRAS, with troops remaining faithful to the Convention, has invaded The H\u00f4tel de Ville. Gendarme M\u00e9da arrests ROBESPlERRE and wounds him with a gun shot. Meanwhile the execution of GUERY takes its own course.. News about the tyrant's death spreads rapidly. The people, freed from the tyrant's ghost, take by storm the fatal carts. ROBESPlERRE has refused to sign the appeal for insurrection which could have saved him. A doctor, quick! He's bleeding to death... and the people demand his head. The Convention, incited by FOUQET, declares the accused's indictment illegal and refuses to try them. ROBESPlERRE listens to his sentence. Between the yelling and shouting of the crowd ROBESPlERRE undergoes his ordeal. The tyrant is toppled... Long live the People... And the prisons, by popular acclaim, hand over the condemned.- Jean GUERY, where is he?- He is safe! The sacrifice has been consummated! TERESlA, faithful to her promise, with tormented heart, will become MADAME TALLlEN. In those days, the grateful people had already given her a name and this is how they cheer her: Long live Our Lady of Thermidor!

You're going to sink us both! Yes, we sink because of you and it's your fault. If you would just be a little more sensible, we could live well... The Colonel will seek you... I demand that you receive him... I command you...! The next morning. The visit of Colonel Sergejewics... Leave that man who is unworthy of you I love you and I put my fortune at your feet. I beg your pardon. I have misjudged you. There may come a time when you need a friend to protect you in this immense and strange country. Remember me then: I will always be available to help you. Contents of the missing part: War breaks out and the day comes when Gitta needs the help of the Colonel, When she no longer supports the infamous Vandoris. Col. Sergej Sergejewics stops the actress as the subject of an enemy country but at the same time helps her flee across the border. At home. Does Mr. Weber still live here? Ah, the good lord died twelve years ago. His beautiful wife ran off with a comedian and he died of grief. What about the child? They say he goes around with bad company. We have not heard from him. Gitta got a contract in a theater... under an assumed name. In a small house in the suburbs Gitta has a small apartment. She always thinks of her son and her thoughts go to the battlefield. A fateful meeting. You thought I had died in prison. No, I would not give you that pleasure! You want to get rid of me. I understand... But it is not so easy. Listen, I've heard of a young millionaire who is in love with you up to his ears. Every night he goes to the theater to see you. Get him to come to you tomorrow night and you will get rid of me forever! What do you want from him? Ma'am, excuse me. I'm so confused, I haven't even introduced myself yet. No, I do not want to know who you are. You will never know who I am. The name you know is just my stage name. We will not see each other in life again. Do not touch it, it is sacred, it is my talisman! I swore to my father on his deathbed never to take it off. My son, my only son, my little Robert! You! Gitta told of the tragedies of her life. Poor, poor mother! We will start a new life. We will be happy. Enough is enough! I have waited a quarter of an hour... but more no! If he does not come out, I will go in... Now I will atone for all my sins. Do not ask any questions. If you loved your father, if you love me, do not ask. Robert caught the car containing Vandoris with the police, but Vandoris had thrown his mother into the river. The son jumped into the river and brought his mother to dry land, but she had drowned. It was too late, there was no hope. The woman paid for her former sins with her life.

{"title": "Semana grafica", "content": "Couldn't you hurry up? I had told you I had an important appointment. I am sorry boss, but the train was late, you know... The train, the train! Nowadays stationmasters are not the same! Back in my day the trains were on time! Welcome, sisters. Thank you. Thank you. After me, please. I was looking forward to commiting to your care my daughter, Monica, my only child. We heard she is a little too restless and quite out of hand, but what can you expect from the girls of today, right? Out of hand? You are kidding me. Monica is a child. Obviously she has her faults, like everyone-- And we'll try to rectify them with Christian patience. Good! But I have to rush now. Sergio! Come here! My wife will take you to the train station by motorboat. I am sorry, but I really have to go. Sergio! Come take the sisters' luggage. Sure, doctor. You must be Monica. And you are her friend? No. She is my mother. How is it possible? It's true, I am the doctor's wife, and therefore I'm her mother. Wake up at 7: 00 with a nice coffee. A coffee tomorrow morning is fine. But now I'd like a digestive liqueur. I ate too much. The food is delicious in these dining cars. Okay, I'll bring it right away. Good evening, sisters. And if you need anything during the night, and I mean, anything... You just have to ring the bell, okay?- Good night.- Good night. Good night, sister. Monica and I are going to sleep. You put me in a compartment different from yours, though, and close to the toilet, too. Sister Nana, I did it with good intentions-- because of your illness. Yes, right. Good night. And remember that you will die.- Sister Nana?- What? We shall die. And what did I say? You said\" you will\". Well, come on, you will, we shall, what's the difference?- Good night.- Good night. Good night. At last we are alone. Who is going to undress first? You're welcome to undress yourself, Monica. I'll take the upper berth. Okay, sister. Do you know why my father is sending me to boarding school? No, I don't know. Why is that? He's mad jealous of Chris, his wife. At his age, he's marrying someone younger than me. You saw her, right? He really wants to be cuckolded, that idiot. She is thirty years younger than him. He really is crazy. Stop it, Monica. Go to sleep. Okay, sister, okay. lf you think that I am going to stay in boarding school for long, you are making a blunder. Sister? What's the matter? Why is it that a pretty girl like you became a sister? Have you ever heard of vocation? Vocation? Judging from your face, your vocation is quite the opposite. Enough, Monica. Be quiet and sleep now. Sister? Don't you undress yourself? Oh, I see. You feel embarrassed because of me. Sister Emanuelle! I am scared!- What's the matter?- Let me stay here close to you. Monica, what are you doing? I am scared.- Monica.- I am so scared. Be a good girl. Don't be a child. I am scared. It's just a storm. Relax. Don't be scared. You'll see, it was only a nightmare. No, it wasn't a nightmare. It was true. It was all true. It was just a night like this. Lightning, thunder. I was soaking wet. I was cold. So cold. And I started running to warm myself. The blinding light of a lightning showed them to me. They were three ugly mugs, and from their faces I immediately understood what their intentions were. They were waiting for me at the opening, like hungry wolves ready to jump at the lost sheep's neck.- What?- Hey! What the--? I started running like crazy. But they were faster than me and caught me in a second. They grabbed me and... Poor child. Now I understand why you are so scared by the storm. Yes, it always reminds me of that event. Those vile men! But you must forgive your torturers, like a Christian martyr. No, I will never forgive them. Those brutes! Monica! Go away! Go away! Go straight to your bed! How dare you behave like that? How dare you! It's unbelievable. Hey, what did I do? I just gave you a little kiss. What a fuss, sister Emanuelle! You really are a lost soul. I lost the soul, but not the body. Monica, are you okay? I am not Monica. I really feel sick. Oh, I am sorry, sister. Do you need any help? I don't really know how you could help me. This cystitis is God's punishment. I will pray for you, sister. Amen. Yes. You're good. Like that. Yes. Go on. Yes. Good. Where have you been? I had a drink. I was so thirsty. Reverend Mother, this is the new student. Help!- I want to leave!- Monica!- I want to go home!- Monica, where are you going? Let me out of here! Stop it! Don't be a child. Stop it. Stop it! Leave me alone! I want to leave! Keep still. Keep still! Don't act like that! No! Enough. Enough! Let me go! She's a maniac. This is crazy. Keep still. Keep still! Give me a hand. Let's turn her over. No! No! Keep her still! When you first came here, I believed in your sincerity in your repentance. I welcomed you, you hardened sinner, because I believed in your will to make good your life, to come out from the filth you had always lived in. I believed, in short, that a divine miracle could happen. And instead-- But I did nothing bad. I don't understand. Nothing, huh? And the panties? Those are nothing for you, huh? The panties? What panties? You wretched woman! I've seen it clearly, while you were wrestling with the possessed girl, that you weren't wearing the panties prescribed by our regulations. Forgive me. Forgive me. It's true, Reverend Mother, I wasn't wearing the chastity panties because my skin can't tolerate rough cloth. Wicked woman! You, a sister, you dare talk about skin? Skin must be chastised, torn, tortured as a sign of repentance for your sins. I will do it. I will do it, Reverend Mother. I will wear the chastity panties as if they were a cilice, to humiliate my flesh, to make it suffer, but please, forgive me. Don't hurl me into the hell I came from. All right. This time I'll forgive you, but remember what I'm telling you. From now on, you sinner, I will keep an eye on you. lf I find you again wearing that dreadful rag of perdition, I will throw you back to secular status, I will invoke upon you all the torments of Satan! I'll have you transferred. Where's the bathroom? Over there. Here? Yes. Tell me, do you often suffer from these fits of hysteria? And do you often suffer from these fits of shittiness? Listen, everyone here knows that you are a pest. That's why they put you in my room. Why? Do you have cholera? No, you don't get it. I am the best in class. I imagined that. And I am the best in conduct, too. From bad to worse. You look like someone who can make a saint lose his patience. Listen to her. Why, do you think you are a saint? Not yet. But I could become one if I'll manage to recover you and turn you into a good girl. That's why they put you with me. It's what I was trying to tell you. Will you cooperate? Don't worry, I'll do my best to make you gain ranks. Sorry. The halo. Thank you so much. We are friends now, aren't we? Sure. Actually, why don't we give each other a little kiss to celebrate? Those who asked me to go somewhere else were like the Earth. And I, who in Carthagine loathed a real poverty, in Rome I hoped in a false happiness. But the true reason for my going to Rome, only you did know that, and you did not tell it to me nor to my mother who sadly cried over my departure and came after me as far as the seashore. I am sorry, she is late, Reverend Mother. I didn't know the hours were so strict. I'm only two minutes late. No, don't sit. You will learn at your cost to be punctual. Take the place of Sister Emanuelle and read. Please, come. But while she held me tight and did violence to me in order to take me back or to come with me, I fooled her...- I am scared!- What are you doing? Are you crazy? Let me stay here with you, please. Alright. You can stay. I knew it. I knew that to become a saint, I should have passed the terrible test of temptation, like every self- respecting saint. Stop it. Go away. Go back in your bed. You had promised me that you would cooperate. It's what I am doing. The storm. Monica! No. No. Stop it. Stop it. Go back in your bed. And let's remember, young girls, that we shall die. Let's remember that we shall die. Let's remember that we shall die. Mother, let's remember that we shall die. Sister Nana. Cure this damned cystitis of yours. Don't wait for a miracle. Look at what you have done. You wetted the corridor. What is this? Do I even have to wet myself? Alright. Let's stop here, girls. Sit down. Sister Emanuelle, can we go to that cottage over there? Why? ls it so urgent?- Well, yes.- Yes. Okay, you go first, Monica. When you come back, Anna will go. Why not together? Hygiene. All right, girls! I'll play with you. Pass me the ball! Keep quiet! That's it, girls. Let's eat now. Well said, sister Emanuelle. Sister Emanuelle? Monica hasn't come back yet. Monica! Take this, Francesca. You took your time, uh? Now you can go, Anna. Wait! I am coming with you. lf I were you, I wouldn't go there. Monica! Mind your own business. Well, I warned you. And I'll tell you again. You'd better wet yourself than die. Die? What are you talking about? I am alive by a miracle. That cottage is infested with vipers. Vipers? Actually, some of them followed me. Oh, Jesus! So, where is this safe refuge? I prepared everything. Up there, in the tower. Follow me. Come! Listen, darling. Are you sure that nobody is going to see us? Don't worry. Everybody is sleeping. You are Rene, right? And how do you know that? Your picture is in every newspaper, together with the tale of your mad ventures. You are a madman, you know? You've scared half of the world with all the mischief you've done. lf they get you, you'll be in trouble. Aren't you afraid then? No. Why should l? On the contrary, I fancy men like you. You trust me, then. Of course. And you, didn't you put yourself completely into my hands by coming here? You're right. And you call this mess a refuge? It's not here. It's upstairs. Well, it's not the Grand Hotel, but it doesn't lack the comforts. What a pretty child. Simple. Sweet. But what a bitch. Are you talking to me? No, no. What time is it? It's 6: 00. I have an hour left before the official call. An hour? There's no time to waste. Yes... Yes! Monica. What is this farce? Where have you been all night? I asked you where you have been. With Sister Emanuelle. So what? Stop it! You are a bitch! You just don't give a damn! You do it on purpose to make me angry. Stop it! You are mean! You are so mean! What are you crying for? How silly of you. Come on, dry me up. Massage my back. No! Forget it! Have your sister Emanuelle massage you. Come on, don't be a bitch. Jealousy doesn't exist for me, and it must not exist between us. lf you won't do as I tell you, you will lose me. Anna. Come on, caress me. Harder. Harder. Are you mistaking my little ass for a baby's? Come on, girls! It's time to go back to class. Anna. Anna! Listen, you have to do me a big favor, please. What do you want? You have to go say something to sister Emanuelle. Never! lf you don't want to be a little saint again you'll have to do as I say. All right. Who is it? Someone. Anna? Anna, what happened? Are you sick? I need to talk to you. But, at this hour? All right. Come on. Speak. Well, Monica is often missing during the night. I realized that she puts a dummy made of rags in her bed to make believe that she is there. She did it tonight too. And where does she go? ln the tower. Why, you didn't know that? Of course, I don't know. And what's her business in the tower? It's what I am asking myself. Why does she go in the tower every night? Anna. It's no good, believe me. This is delation, curiosity. Go right back to your room now, and beg God's forgiveness for all these sinful thoughts. Yes, sister. Stay where you are! The show is not finished yet. Okay, okay, go on. I'll stay here. Go on. Go on. Come on, little bitch! Show me what they taught you in this school. Yes. Yes. Yes. Emanuelle, Emanuelle... Emanuelle! Don't move. Monica. Listen. Who is she? Are all the school's students like her? She is not a student. She is a nun. Monica! And who are you? Oh, I am sorry. Let me introduce myself. I am Rene. Wanted by all the European law enforcements for a few rapes, a few robberies, some drugs. You know how it is, sister, one has to earn one's living. It was you that let him in here? Yes. He was so nice to me. I am going to immediately report his presence to the Reverend Mother. No! You can't, sister. And who is going to stop me, you? Him. Sister. Sister, I'd rather not be wanted for slaughter. Therefore, I think you'd better be good and quiet. Monica, how could you-- I am sorry, sister. Only you and I know about Rene's presence here. We are joined by a terrible secret now. Whether you like it or not, we are your accomplices. So? All right, I won't talk. But let it be clear. I am doing this only for the students' safety. I don't want to be responsible for a massacre. Anna! What are you doing up here? Didn't I tell you to go to your room and beg forgiveness for your sins? And you? Why don't you go and beg forgiveness for yours? Anna. You are upset. You don't know what you're saying. Actually, I know it pretty well. Monica told me everything. What you mean? That you are her lover, she confessed me that, and that you meet in secret in the tower. Did she really tell you that? Yes. And you believed her? Yes. Anna. Look into my eyes. I swear on my clothes, on my soul, that there's absolutely nothing true in what Monica has told you. She is a wicked girl. Worse that I thought. You must believe me, Anna. Anna, please. You must believe me. Yes, I believe you. But now I am pleased with your reaction. Learning such a terrible thing about your teacher, about a nun, must have been a very hard blow for your purity and your innocence. What did you feel, my poor little Anna? An unbearable jealousy. Frightening. I didn't know I could be capable of such a thing. Jealousy? Jealous of me? Of course. Because I love Monica. But now I understand that it's just been a joke to tease me. Thank you, sister. Bring the bread. Yes, I'll do it. Good morning, sister Emanuelle. I heard that it was your turn at the refectory. Are you mad at me, sister Emanuelle? Monica, how many lies did you make up? Why did you tell Anna that we-- What was I supposed to tell her? That there is a criminal in the tower ready to kill us all? I choose the lesser evil. Monica. You definitely have the skill of muddling my ideas. Why did you lure me into the tower? Why did you drag me in your intrigues? Why is there so much perversion inside you? I have already explained you the tragedy of my life, but you haven't understood me. I've understood you pretty well. You've suffered an abuse when you were a kid and your psychic balance has been compromised. Yet, this doesn't excuse you. You see? You say that you understand me and then you put the blame on me. Monica, it is how you've reacted to that abuse that I can't understand. You should hate men for what they have done to you, but you don't hate them at all. Actually, for quite a while I've been hating men with all my strength. Monica, what are you doing? But Dad... Didn't you tell me to make friends with my stepmother? That's why that asshole of my father decided to send me to boarding school. Tell me, sister Emanuelle, wouldn't you hate such a man with all your strength? Enough! Stop it! What's wrong with you? You try your best to wring my secrets from me and then you get angry. You sisters are really strange, you know? Monica, what is this joke? How dare you put your nightgown under my pillow? So why did you put it on? Please, let's not quarrel over a nightgown. Yes, I wanted to play a joke on you. But now something very serious has happened. That's why I am here, sister Emanuelle. Okay, let's hear it. What's wrong? Rene. How dare you talk to me about that bandit? Sister! Listen to me, for Heaven's sake. Okay, speak. Rene wants me to take Anna into the tower. What? He said that if I won't bring her to him, he'll come and take her himself. with all the possible consequences. But Anna is like a child, and she is a virgin, too. As far as men are concerned. That's the point. He is saying that he's never met a virgin in his life. Do you know what I mean? And this thing arouses him a lot. Sister, help me! What am I supposed to do? All right. Don't worry. I'll go talk to him. Hi. You want Anna, right? You pig! You'll never have her! I'll offer myself in place of her. Come on! Give vent to your bestial instincts on me. Leave alone that poor innocent soul. But... I don't understand a thing, I swear. What does this mean? Come on! Are you coming? What are you waiting for? Hey, how impatient you are! Well done. You behave like you didn't like it. You are forgetting that I sacrificed myself in place of Anna. Sacrificed? Actually, it's the first time that Rene the rapist gets raped. Speaking of Anna... Enough! Stop provoking me. Okay, okay. But could you please tell me who the hell is this Anna? Wait a second. You forgot your nightgown. What's the matter with you? Are you out of your minds? Gerolamo! So you two are claiming that the gardener addressed you with indecent proposals, contrary to morality, and since you refused, he fired at you. Yes. Sister Nana. Mother, believe me, those girls are two liars. How come did he come by this obscene dress then?- Reverend Mother...- Shut up! You'll talk later. He is saying that he doesn't know what this thing is. He thought it was a rag when he found it. It's the Devil's work! Reverend Mother, I am guilty of all this. Reverend Mother. I have to make a terrible confession. Shut up! This is not the time to confess. Let's hear the defendant. It's not true that I didn't yield to this funny old man. Only Anna found the strength to deny herself. I, on the contrary, possessed by the demon of lust, I wasn't able to resist his lascivious caresses. Enough! We were feeding a snake in our womb without knowing it. Here is my sentence. The unworthy filthy gardener, Gerolamo Collegno, is dismissed from his job. The student Monica Cazzabriga is expelled from this boarding school. The student Anna Celestini will be rehabilitated by us to Heaven. Amen. Amen. I don't understand why you are putting that face. Aren't you happy to take me to the train station? Yes, boarding school is not for me. But I had fun, though. It's been a brief experience, but a very happy one. Why did you stop here? What's the matter with you? lf we don't hurry, I'll miss my train! Are you out of your mind? Sister Emanuelle, are we going? Dear Monica, you've may have had a brief and happy experience, but I haven't, I guarantee you. Since I've had the misfortune of meeting you, you've forced me to sin, to forsake my duties and my conscience too. You've been playing with me like the cat plays with the mouse. You've forced me to lie, to break the vow I had made, to be party to your depraved games. From now on, I will conduct the game. I will show you who Emanuelle is, and what you have awakened in her. Where are you taking me? What are you doing? Where are we going?- Keep quiet! Go ahead.- What are you up to? Don't you remember those damned vipers? I want to see them too. You are crazy! Leave me alone! Oh, why? Why? What are you going to do to me? Have you gone out of your mind?- Come here.- Leave me alone! What are you doing? Now I'll show you if I have gone out of my mind. Where are you going? Come here! Untie me. Rene! Come here! Come untie me. No, Rene. Not with her. No. No! No, no! Me too! Me too! Let me join you. Please! Be good, darling. Don't be impatient. It's your turn, now. No! No! Who is it? Good morning, sister. It's 7: 00. I brought you the coffee. May I come in? Thank you, in five minutes. Okay. Did you sleep well? Yes, sister, I slept well. But I feel a strange sensation. Painful. Like a stinging right here. Come, Monica. Reverend Mother, this is the new student. Monica Cazzabriga, Reverend Mother. I heard about your restless temperament, but I can see that you are a well- mannered and respectful girl. May I go? Thank you. Monica? Come. Girls, this is your new mate. Here name is Monica.- Lucia.- Donatella.- Maria.- Bea. Hi. Come. And this is Anna. Anna is the best of the school in every sense. She will share her room with you.

Its contents are poor and paltry... Love, money, tuxedoes,\" good manners\". They all are distinctive examples of cinema usage to present\" delights\" of bourgeois lifestyle as an ideal for every man. The contents are so sincere, that they don't even conceal the moral turpitude of the main attitude. Woman's beauty, and love, everything can be bought and everything can be sold. Be Silent, My Sorrow, Be Silent Director: P. I. Chardynyn Lead actors: Vera Kholodnaya, V. Maksimov, O. Runich, A.

Don't drink, Lorio, you have a difficult piece today. I'm sorry. I won't anymore. I'll be ready soon. Dump him and come with me. With my talent and your beauty... We'll conquer the world. No! That would be terrible. Stop it! I have to work now. Flirting again. I'll kill you! Go, you fool! Only because of her. Be silent, my sorrow, be silent. What a hell of boring day! What on earth can we do? What if we go to the circus today? Oh, I told you, told you! So? He will definitely survive... but will be crippled for the rest of his life. You?! Why?! Here! It's what the comrades have collected for Lorio.- What will you do now?- The doctor said he can work no more. Leave him. I'll create a career for you, you couldn't possibly have dreamed of. Pola, you wouldn't leave me? I'll get better... We'll start working together.\" The Fairytale of Dear Love\" Wake up, Pola, it is time Be silent my sorrow, be silent! Be silent, my sorrow, be silent! But you've really been affected by this songstress. No it's not that... I've got an idea: Why don't we invite her to our bachelor party. What a splendid idea! Come in, the master is asking for you. Tomorrow I'm having a party and I suggest you take part in it. Of course, you will be handsomely rewarded. You'll come, won't you? So, I'll be waiting for you at eight tomorrow evening. And this is a down payment. No, I definitely can't go. I have nothing to wear. Why don't you wear a costume, you used to wear at the circus? The party. Would you permit me to try this on you? This necklace fit's Mademoiselle so well, that if I were you I wouldn't look for another neck. Mademoiselle, this necklace is yours. In deals such as this, the intermediary receives his brokerage. I'm still waiting. In cinema, scenes of this kind usually end up with a diaphragm. We'd be delighted if you would sing something for us. I hope that after dinner you will sing some more. But now, everybody to the table. Now I remember where I saw you: Didn't you use to work at the circus?- Did you seen me there?- Yes, I did, At that ill- fated performance, where your partner collapsed. Pola, just say one word and everything before you will be yours. Stop it. You're drunk enough already! Drunk, me? But then again, I am drunk, really... Let's say our goodbyes and go home. Here, the master has asked me to deliver this. Thank your master for me. Fool! She is angry. Stop it... I'm tired of this! Tired! but what can we do? We have to go out today. Go where? Reeling around courtyards? Enough! I will not go anymore! Do you understand? I will not! Alright. Then I will go alone. Even alone I will earn something. What do you think? Yes, this is the only way out. Sell this and end everything!... Be silent, my sorrow, be silent.- Someone is asking for you?- Who is it? That songstress. Stay with me and you will have everything.- A letter from the lady.- What lady? You'll find out. I won't return to you. Why? You must understand yourself. I want to protect the memories we shared. Send the costume I played in and the guitar. The money is for you. Goodbye. And if you can... Forgive me. Answer? Here! Give the money to the lady. Those things. There, take them! Don't you dare! D'you hear me. I won't let you take this. Give me a cigarette. You'll be punished if the master finds out. You've lost? Tell me the truth. I'll bail you out, but remember. This is the last time.- Don't you think it's too much?- But, this is the latest trend.- You might as well be naked.- What do you mean? Just look at yourself. Hurry up, I have a music class at twelve. What shall we do this evening?- Nothing! We'll stay at home.- Home? But that's so boring. But I would have liked so much to ride in a carriage to the gypsies. I think you'd rather move to the public house completely. I said you were just a beautiful mannequin for him. You are just for show. He has no interest in your soul. Stop! I'm going to sing myself.

I have talked to Knut Huseby, and you will receive a warm welcome. Knut Huseby- Theodor Blich Aslaug. Knut Huseby's daughter- Gull Cronvall You don't seem to succeed much better then the rest of us in pleasing the Huseby wolf Sigurd and Oivind, Huseby's sons- Hugo Tranberg and Gosta Cederlund Since I've been given a daughter, I'm obliged to protect her, boys You are so right, father. Whoever makes his way here will be saluted by me Should we baptize him? There you go! I think you dampened his burning desire. Tore Naesset was only a smallholder's son, but was nevertheless reputed... to be the one who most frequently visited the Huseby farmer's daughter. Tore Naesset- Lars Hanson Darling, come what may, tomorrow I will speak with your father. Tomorrow I will follow you to Huseby and propose in Knut's presence. On Sunday, after Tore had escorted his mother home from church... he set out to address Huseby, just like he had promised Aslaug. Tore's mother- Hilda Castegren No, no, my lad, don't even think of such haughtiness. You, a poor smallholder's son, could never get the daughter at Huseby. I most certainly can, little Mum. It's plain to see that these two suit each other well. Although the girl is a little shy, of course. Is your father at home? You, Knut Huseby, are a wealthy man, and I myself am no church mouse. You have many children, and I only have this one son. What if you gave my son your daughter's hand in marriage? It seems a fair offer, but in this case my daughter will have to make her own decision. Go out and find Aslaug, Sigurd. Father wants a word with you, Aslaug, and he won't be pleased to know... that you stand here wasting time with the smallholder boy from Nesset,... when a bloke like Ola Thormundsen has come to propose to you. It so happens that Aslaug and I have loved each other for a long time. I have come here to ask for her hand. If I can't have Tore, I will not spend another happy day in this world As yet, there is no tradition here on Huseby for farmers' daughters... to share the marriage bed with smallholders' sons. Nevertheless, that day is likely to arrive. The end of Act 1 A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 2 A few days later. Aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture. The next Saturday night. Only one road led to the Huseby summer farm, and it passed right by the main farm. Would you believe that boy! He seems to be heading for the mountain farm! God's peace on the summer farm! God's peace to you too. It's just not right that this smallholder stud should be allowed up at the Huseby summer farm. Well, if no one else can keep him at bay... I guess me and my sons should give it a try. I may still possess some talent in that direction. Come on, boy, let's have a bout! Enough for today, fiddler! Come back soon, and I'll give you some more! Don't forget your fiddle when you come to our wedding. A lazybone like you will have to accept whatever comes his way. While Aslaug faithfully yearned, Tore approached the Huseby farm. If next Saturday you manage to slip past the Huseby wolf and his cubs, the girl will be yours. The end of Act 2 A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 3 A few days passed. Since Tore visit to the farm, there had been no news from the valley. What do you want, my lad? How do you do up here, Aslaug? You are probably a bit lonely now that Nesset cannot come here anymore? Yes, he got what he deserve. We fixed him up so well last Saturday night,... that he's probably lost all desire to go courting again at the Huseby mountain farm. Come next Saturday. Tore was fit again, although not in such high spirits as he used to be. If next Saturday you manage to slip past the Huseby wolf and his cubs, the girl will be yours. In the worst case, I'll get a good beating! We're just here to make sure that the smallholder boy from Nesset stays away from the summer farm tonight. Yes, we would like to join you. Position yourselves two at every hill. If he approaches, whistle! I bet Ola would love to go to the mountain farm himself tonight. The two of us as well. The girl will finally have to give up... because the engagement will be broken off tonight. The boys will stand guard down here. The end of Act 3 A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 4 It was on a Saturday evening. I had been awaiting you. You promised me to come, but your promise proved untrue. Where could you find a rose where no rose ever grows? Where can true love be found if your sweetheart lets you down? God's peace on the mountain farm! God's peace to you too! That fellow is worth having. The girl shall be his. The shimmering summer air hangs over Hardangerfjord. Against the sky in bluish hue the mighty mountains loom. The glacier shines, the hillsides are green. The clime is clad in its finest attire. And behold! Over green, clear waves a bridal procession sails.

Do you want to tarnish the soul of this fair maiden with your hate? You are strong, help us to fight them. Take this sword. Never. Don't count on me. I'm not much good as a bloodhound. The incident last night has shattered his constitution. He barely is himself anymore. Stop, captain. I know my duty as well you know yours. I will fight on your side! My sword will prove that Count Borotin is no accomplice to the bandits. What was that? A shot! Where were you? And how did you get wounded? I heared the shot from my chamber. As I knew your father was outside, I wanted to help, ran down and was shot. To proceed seemed dangerous, so I returned. We almost caught the leader of the bandits. I shot him in the arm, we fought, and he escaped, but he left this piece of cloth. Act Five Bandit! Yes, I am the one they are searching for. I am the cursed bandid Jaromir. My Berta, don't be sterner than God. Don't reject me, you lovely. If you don't escape with me, I shall stay. Here they shall bind me, chain me, then you will see my bones rot. Escape with me. At 12 o'clock I will wait at the crypt. But one more thing, child- get me weapons. Don't be afraid. Your vow gave my life new meaning. It wouldn't take weapons to take me to freedom. This bottle would be enough. If it puts your mind at rest, take it. Isn't this a dagger? Don't take it, it's cursed. Farewell my child, the future is bright and don't forget midnight. This underground corridor leads to the dungeons of my castle. They brought one of the bandits, sir. He wants to talk to you. He says, it is important for him and for you. 20 years ago I passed the castle, when I saw a handsome boy at the lake. I made him follow me into the dark forest. Act Six The others wanted to kill him, but I took pity on him. So your son became mine. He forgot you and honored me as his father. And I thought he had drowned, because his hat floated on the lake. God, my son is alive. Bring him to me, even though he is a bandid, I thank you. He is here, he is the stranger that found shelter here. Jaromir, my brother! Tumble, you pillars of earth, the son has killed his father. I am not your son? Look at this ground, you walk on your ancestors' heritage, you are a Count Borodin. Light at the chapel? I want to see, see, see, even if I should perish. All sins will be forgiven, but not patricide. Berta, Berta, escape with me. I am not your Berta. Illusion from hell, You are not my Berta. Everything in vain, I will not let you. This is Berta's face and there is my place! Part in peace, you peaceless.

Since Nolff settled there, a year ago, no one else dared to approach, and those that did ran full of fear. A great fear, superstitious, connected to the memory of his tragic existence. A long, long time ago... Full of contempt for men, of the\" mainland\"... Nolff built his house upon a rock blessed by the wild sea.... The ocean, his nets, his boat, and his wife and daughter, were all he needed. The heart of this strong man, known as the\" Man of the Sea\". Dad!... Mom just bought me... a little brother! After six anxious days spent in the sea, Nolff was happy: he had everything his savage pride wanted: A son! There it is, woman: you, you will raise the girl... and I will take care of the boy, and make him the brave son of Nolff: A free man, a sailor! I will care for him until he is old enough, and show him what is his destiny. So Michel and Djenna grew up side by side... but raised by different hands. Raised by her mother in righteous work, Djenna had great qualities... By contrast, Michel... Cleverly exploiting the blind love of his father, and its increasing weakness, Michel revealed his bad instincts... Now that you smoke like a big man, you can come with me to the sea... to meet your fate. His son hates the sea!\" He will love it someday...\" Nolff thought, trying to mitigate his sorrow. But over the years, Michel... Wanted to know... more and more about the city, and the attractions that were offered on the\" mainland\". Lia... a newcomer. At home, the mother is weak, Michel's father is concerned, but today is Easter, the only day of the year Nolff agrees to reunite with his family... with other people, in the great feast of Riec... To avoid a confrontation, Djenna, who loves her brother... Guenn-\" The Mole\"- a fun companion... They are ready, change your clothes quickly. Dad will be angry... if you do not join us. Have you seen him? No... but... he must have already gone by.. Eventually they are joined, invoking an imaginary pain. As always, Michel need money, and as always, his father... It's noon... Mass ended, and Michel did not appear. An enemy. To your health, Nolff! And your son? Has he gone to sea... this time? No.. he is injured... the knee. He accidentally hit it upon landing. The habitual indulgence of his father and the spirit of partying... again served as an excuse for Michel... and that evening, at the festival... To cheer up Michel, his mother... in spite of her sick heart... Dizzy... As Djenna... and left... At dusk, the mother did not improve... and something else began to weigh on their minds. Michel is misbehaving... Aren't you too lenient with him? Too lenient? Please! Michel is right: The boys have to have some fun. Here's how they become men! But as soon as Nolff was just... Night falls, stormy. Overcome with anguish, Djenna awakens the feverish patient. Nolff... while... Michel...... In the slum of vice... A nuisance... Illusions. Michel! Michel!

Tomorrow you go to sea to work. The sea is the great saint... it purifies... Promise? The mother had been dead for several days, which meant little to Michel. So he had to go to sea, and his evil obsession grew. Our father was out fishing all night... When you return, tell him I will practicing rowing. Time passed, and Michel... I told you about it...

{"title": "Prastankan", "content": "THE PARSON'S WlDOW Now, as a thousand years ago, the waterfall sings by the old Norwegian village. If we listen closely, it tells a lot about the days gone by. Hear, O hear my voice proclaim. Come all ye from far and near. I summon you to elect a parson. For we have no good shepherd here. These two had wandered over the mountain from a neighboring parish... Sofren had struggled through long student days and now he was applying for the vacant post. Mari had waited faithfully during all the hard years. Mari reminds Sofren that her father will not allow them to marry until Sofren is truly a parson. Sofren's two rivals to the post had faith in their handsome clothes and the fine learning that was crammed into them in Copenhagen. Each of the three candidates wished heartily for the Devil himself to take away the others.\" In the beginning, Man, unlike others creatures, was made in the image of God.\"\" But we must consider why it was that God made Man so perfect and magnificent...\"\" I am going to speak to you about Balaam's ass and God's strange power--- by which He was able to open the jaws of a dumb animal so that it might speak like a man!\"\" Now, two learned applicants have appeared here before me.\"\" One of them took us to Eden. And that is as far back as we can go.\"\" Let him stay there!\"\" The other one chose the text: Am I Not An Ass? But what has an ass to do on the pulpit?\"\" My friends, I will not take you to Eden--- you are too clever. But I will take you to the bowels of the Earth, deep in the roaring jaws of Hell!\"\" And so, my friends, beware that you are not swallowed up by the roaring jaws of Hell!\" The congregation had appointed five wise and trusted men to pass verdicts on the applicants. When the two theologians from Copenhagen saw they could not reach their goal by words alone, they joined forces to invite everyone to a feast that evening. Out of common decency, they were obliged to invite Sofren too. At last, the verdict was Sofren.\" According to the law of our parish, the late parson's widow, Dame Margarete, claims the right to demand that his successor marry her.\"\" Since Dame Margarete insists on her right, we have asked her to come here tonight so the candidate may have a look at her.\"\" Night has fallen already. Will you do me the honor to accompany me to the parsonage?\" Sofren had heard that Dame Margarete might be a witch. But he did not feel it would do him any harm just to enter the house.\" My lot is not an easy one. This the fourth time I must be handed over like a piece of furniture to whomever claims me...\"\" But I am attached to this place, to every chair and candlestick...\"\"... and if you part with what has become so important to your life, your innermost heart gets torn open. And you die...\"\" You are not engaged to any young maiden, are you?\"\" I hope that you will accept my hospitality. It is dark and long way to the Inn.\" The next morning, Sofren woke up late. Never in his life had he been so well dressed! He wore a black coat and breeches that had been put beside his bed.\" I had the most wonderful sleep last night. I felt I was resting in Abraham's bosom.\"\" Indeed... there I have never slept.\" In front of him lay a gleaming white herring. He was drawn to it as if by a magic power. Dame Margarete's two old servants had been with her as long as anyone could remember. After Sofren had eaten the fat herring and emptied the bottle of schnapps, he felt very strange. As if in a fog, he saw Dame Margarete, not old and ugly, but as a young smiling girl.\" Dame Margarete, I love you! Let me stay here with you always.\"\" Isn't it so, Master Sofren, that you offered me your heart and hand and asked me to be your wife?\"\" Of course you will have your freedom. You have your room and I have mine. I only wish to stay and manage everything as before.\"\" Sofren, how could you!\"\" How did the widow bewitch you?\"\" With a herring she gave me.\"\" It made me so dizzy that I proposed to her.\"\" I cannot get you if I do not get the post, and I will not get that unless I wed the old woman.\"\" But after she dies, I inherit everything. Then we can marry.\"\" Can Dame Margarete really not see who it is?\" Why, it is my sister Mari.\"\" She is so unhappy at having to leave me! I beg you to let Mari live at the parsonage in return for help around the house.\"\" Do you think the old woman will be done for soon?\" A few weeks later, a neighboring parson joined the two in wedlock. Even though both bride and bridegroom preferred a quiet ceremony, it was the custom in the area to hold a big celebration.\" We will now drink to the health of the bridal couple and wish them a long and happy life.\" The day after the wedding. Sofren made up for it.\" In the future. I suggest you and your companions be less high and mighty. For I am master of this house.\"\" Master Sofren is too big for his boots. Give him a drubbing!\"\" I suggest you concentrate on prayers and sermons. Do not play master here. I am master of this house!\" Time passed by... Dame Margarete had not yet died and Sofren had not been able to see Mari alone. It was not the only time that Sofren was unlucky.\" Oh! The Parson cast amorous glances at me!\"\" Let the fine fellow go!\"\" I will have you know I am a decent girl!\" Sofren was at his wit's end. Finally he stooped to courting at night just as peasant lads did.\" I had a sudden stomachache and was just going to ask my sister for some drops.\"\" If you need drops, you had better come to me!\" Sofren would not give up. A night or two later he tried again.\" My little popsy!\"\" Shame, that you cannot leave us girls alone!\" One evening they sat together all three, working.\" Do you know what country folk say about you, Dame Margarete? That you got your former husband through black magic!\" I also wonder a good deal about that herring you gave me--- was it real?\" No, it had a spell cast upon it!\"\" And they say you have a potion which can prolong one's life.\"\" It must be the truth... just look at me. I will live for at least another hundred years!\" A few nights later the full moon came shining into Dame Margarete's chamber.\" Never have I seen the like. The Devil himself walking in the pastor's slippers!\" A couple of hours went by but Dame Margarete held out bravely.\" So that is how the Devil looks!\" Sofren did one stupid trick after another. However, one day something happened of the greatest importance to everybody.\" Shouldn't you prepare your Sunday sermon instead of idling here?\" Sofren hoped Dame Margarete would stay up in the loft and mayby in the meantime he could meet Mari. But Mari was where Sofren least expected.\" Be careful, Dame Margarete! The ladder is gone!\"\" The thigh- bone is broken and she suffered a concussion. But she will recover.\" Several weeks passed before Sofren was allowed to enter the sickroom. During this time, Sofren truly grew fond of Dame Margarete, who nursed little Mari day and night as tenderly as a mother.\" I am reminded of my youth...\"\" My first husband and I were engaged for many years when he applied for the post here and learned he could have it only if he wedded the parson's widow.\"\" We knew that the widow was weak and could scarcely live long. It was a sore temptation to us...\"\" Yes, God forgive us. We built our happiness on the hope of another's death.\"\" Five years we had to wait. But these rooms hold memories of thirty happy years, and in the churchyard is a grave that is never out of my thoughts.\"\" Forgive us, Dame Margarete!\"\" Mari and I are not sister and brother--- she is my fiancee. We have also waited for your death, Dame Margarete!\"\" Poor children! Poor children!\" Not long afterwards, Mari was on her feet again--- thanks to Dame Margarete's tender care. But Dame Margarete now spent half the day in the churchyard by her first husband's grave. One morning at breakfast, Dame Margarete was missing. Do not forget, when my mortal remains are taken away, to put a horseshoe over the door and to strew linseed after me so that I shall not haunt you. A week later the funeral took place.\" I render thanks for all the good I have known in my days.\" My voice I raise by tones of bells In praise of the Lord of Lords. To call God's folk to church And now to sound a burial hymn. Following her own wish, Dame Margarete was buried with her first husband.\" We owe her a great debt, Mari. She taght you to keep a good home, and she taught me to be a honorable man.", "imdb_url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0011607", "imdb_id": "tt0011607", "year": "1920", "rated ": "TV-14", "genre": "Comedy, Drama, Horror", "plot": "A young man is elected by a small village to be its parson.

And it made him confused, confident, and waiting with a light heart! He dared not... yet. He doubted for a moment, but the inner urge was stronger than his shyness... How innocent and naive you are!... And you are called a\" devil\"...! And in the arms of this woman, who was far above him, the young man remembered his sad childhood, as vulnerable orphans... And the young man felt dizzy in his leap From great pain to great bliss which he had never felt before... And he remembered that morning, when old Cechi, his acrobatics teacher, adopted the children. These are my grandchildren, sir, who are without any parents!... I cannot provide for them... Maybe they can discuss with you a way to earn the living that they need...! Where did you come from, children?... Have you no home? Why have you come here? Have you no mother? Is she dead?

Diagnosis: Deep penetrating gunshot wound in third intercostal space. Prognosis:... Prognosis: The wound can be lethal.\" Stay here... If something happens, call me.\"\" Let her have some rest! Interrogation is meaningless now and even dangerous!\" No one will know my name, this will be the only secret I take to the grave. I'm just- a woman. Before I'll go and probaly find my death, I want to write enough for you to know the truth... I'll tell you my life as if you were my confessor... When I was 18, I still stayed in Ursuline school... I didn't know my mother well- I met her only during her rare visits. And I didn't know anything about my other relatives. I hadn't seen her for five months already... And one day the director called me...\" Listen, child... I haven't heard from your family for many months... I wrote them, but in vain. I send a telegram to your mother four days ago, but there is still no answer. What should I think?\" We inform you that the telegram No. 2851, which was sent by you on 21 of September, wasn't delivered to addressee because of her death. Head of the department. After my mother's death I had to leave the boarding school. I was so alone in this world... A month passed, and recommendations from my friends helped me to find a place as a lady's companion for quite a stern countess. Her son was a young diplomat. I believed his words, and loved him with all my soul, with all passion of the first love. The spring was in full bloom... Several month of the most carefree happiness... And then I felt the first dreadful grief... The same night, I forgot about cautions and came to him, demanding explanations for his behavior.\" I court her only to please my mother-- she wants this marriage, but I love only you\"\" You must leave this house immediately...\" And, though i was completely exhausted, I left the same night...... I still had a secret hope that he looked for me...... I saw that he is incapable of performing even a magnanimous act!.. In this moment of utmost suffering my dream castle collapsed... Where to go? What to do? Darkness of starless night reigned in my wounded soul...\" She's with me!\"\" I saved you!\" Some time later...\" I'm a gentleman and I do not expect something in return from you... You can stay here as long as you like...\" I stayed with people, with whom I brought together by fate. They took care of me, and the fruit of my first mistake was passed to a wet- nurse in a village.... Year late I still had an exciting life I still held money that I wanted to send to my little baby...... to the daughter of the man, who was sitting right in front of me.... And desire for revenge started an all- devouring fire in my soul...... Heaviness of a momentary regret... My child became just an incentive for my revenge. I was imprudent enough to turn for help to my accomplices... And only later I understood why they agreed so readily... I became his shadow in the city...\" Do you know her?\"\" No!\"\" She is an adventuress... People says that she was a lady's companion for a noble, and then she was seduced and left by a young aristocrat...\"\" She even had a baby from him...\"\" Now I see, why she's following me...\"\" I ask you... Beg you... We need to talk...\" Carnival... my revenge... Madam, if you come to Belmont street,\u2116 57, second floor, at 5 o'clock, you'll see your husband in very interesting company\"\" No... I agreed to meet you only to talk about our daughter\" And at five o'clock sharp... Madam, if you come to Belmont street,\u2116 57, second floor... Without his family's support, he became an easy prey for these two swindlers...\" I had my ear to the ground for two years already... His Excellency should return him to active service... give him a mission that make him tie a can on this...\"\" I'm lost!... Lost!... I'm ruined!\"... Was it pity? Compassion? I don't know... t was a new feeling arising in the darkness of my soul... Feeling, that reminded me of my past love and my distant sweetheart daughter...\" Come with me. We will run away! We still can find happiness\" The family tried to save him... So, he was called up to active service by the order from His Excellency Prime- Minister. He was given a special mission.... And when a small innocent creature cuddled up to my chest, the wave of pity and sadness flooded my heart...... I felt and understood all the horror of my life and grasped for my little daughter as for a life belt.... I decided to make a clean break with the past and reunite with my dear baby. My life will belong only to her!\" Prepare her belongings... I'll take her tomorrow\"\" You will carry these maps of mine fields... I trust you this task, because I believe in your intellect and your honour!\"... I suspect that you will become a victim for those people, with whom fate had brought me together.... I told you everything... I love you, as I loved you back then, in your house. Do you remember? Now I want to go very far away... with my baby... You should return to your home...

If we could have a copy of them before the government start negotiations that would be a great success.\" This is a mission I trust to your honour...\" And I could put him in such disgrace? I go crazy just thinking that he might...\" So- Do we have a deal? Will you follow our instruction?\"\" I do not trust you... I want to know where is my daughter before I'll do something!\"\" I'll tell you, because the child is well- hidden and you will not be able to do anything...

Thanks to their vigorous presence, attractive appearance and starring in dramas larger than life, they achieved fame and glory not only in Italy but in the whole silent world.Among these \"divas\" was Frau Pina Menichelli, a silent film star who achieved such privileged films status thanks to the help of Herr Giovanni Pastrone. Pastrone gave her the leading role in important films that definitely launched her career.Frau Menichelli was at the top of her silent stardom when she starred \"La Storia Di Una Donna\" (1920), a film directed by Herr Eugenio Perego. It was a very outstanding drama that was one of the last Frau Menichelli's oeuvres before her retirement from the silent screen four years later.\"La Storia Di Una Donna\" is a film tailored for Frau Menichelli. It's, an obscure silent drama, remarkable in many moments for its atmosphere but that unfortunately suffers from the scarce performance of the Italian diva.Throughout the whole film, Frau Menichelli limits herself to posing with the same hieratic face ( half-open mouth and a gaze lost somewhere over the silent horizon ). She expresses absolutely nothing and her performance is void. For example, when her character can be seen laying in a bed at the hospital, unconscious with terrible gunshots wounds, her face displays more emotion that when she was alive?And that's a pity because \"La Storia Di Una Donna\" is a very remarkable film. It is told in flashback form and depicts the story of a teenager orphan girl. She works as a lady in waiting for a countess and is seduced by her son. Once the countess learns of this love affair, she is dismissed (both not knowing both that the woman is pregnant). She will be rescued from the streets by a crook and from then on seeks on a vendetta (a good Italian word, nat\u00fcrlich! ).. By taking advantage of this situation, the crook will use her against her former lover.Fortunately Frau Menichelli is accompanied by two good actors. Herr Luigi Serventi und Herr Livio Pavanelli give emotion and motion to the picture in recreating a genuine silent drama settled in elegant and sordid sceneries ( with excellent and careful art design ) that gives mood to a thrilling and obscure story full of revenge and even repentance.For all this, \"La Storia Di Una Donna\" is a remarkable Italian silent drama full of artistic merits that even Frau Menichelli can't waste and is evidence that a good story in the hands of a skillful director always triumphs despite adverse fate.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must avoid the tempestuous mood of a Teutonic rich diva.", "language": "None", "country": "Italy", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmI5OWZlZjctMDM1OC00NzFkLWI4NmEtZWU5NTg3NTgwOTMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTcwNjUwNzk@._V1_SX300.jpg", "imdbRating": "6.6", "type": "movie"}

Life had revealed her aspect of peace, and with Mara, as if by miracle, more intense seemed to him the blooming of spring... Someone who had known her very well... It's Mara!- Hush! She is with her engineer! Mara in love? Do not talk nonsense! She may well want to receive the tributes of an old friend! I think you're mistaken, sir! You think then that it ends thus, in laughing? Oh! Why can't we kill the creature we love, and then resurrect it with a virgin body and a new soul! The Triumph of Death Yes! Yes, you're right... But what do you want from me now? If I love you so... immensely... It is needless to dwell! I want to show that proud little woman how to treat old friends! Ms. Flores has charged me to repeat that she does not know you, and that in all cases, she has no wish to meet you! It is useless! I'm at your disposal! So much fear for so little. See? He soon realized it was no use to insist and went away! But, soon as alone, desperate and afflicted, she runs to her old friend's house! I fear a duel. Franco won't tell me anything. For the love of God, inquire... At dawn... Is it a serious situation? Where? You must tell me where is the place of the duel, and I want to find him, cost what it may! Seven in the morning... To my mother, in the case of my death. What has happened to my son? Franco! Franco! Where is my son? As you see, I always tried to protect your son from the accusations of the Board of Directors, but now it is no longer possible. It is thus necessary for him to return to work, and to leave the woman who will drag him more and more irremediably towards ruin... I'm not there for anyone. He went out? And you don't know where he went? No, ma'am. What do you still want from my brother? Where is Franco? If you know it, say it now, for Heaven's sake! A duel? TO BE CONTlNUED PART ElGHT Speak!

You're right!.. Forgive, madam, all the harm I've done him, and do not condemn me... And the beautiful illusion had thus vanished forever. Thank you very much, my friend, for your loving words, but for me can no longer be there any solace! My dear Franco, I have seen crying your mother, I got the news of your downfall, and I pondered! Franco, it is necessary for you to return to think about your work! I myself want your salvation. I myself want to take you back to the workshop!... And so it was. Franco obeyed to her whims, and followed her in those stern places, as he once had followed her on the path of pleasure. No, Franco, this love must have the image of a smile. You must work. It's early, my love, stay a little longer here with me... Do you love me? You'll love me forever? Even when I'm dead? Even if I were no longer beautiful? Forever! Forever! Why are you crying?

This was primarily in two film different film genres in which the Italians achieved great artistic supremacy and merits: epic historical silent films and melodrama.Although \"L'Innamorata\" (1920) has nothing in common with these two classic film genres, what makes this early Italian silent picture special is precisely its modernity.The film was directed by Herr Gennaro Righelli who has a prolific silent career working in many Italian film companies and even he had a successful career in Germany where silent elders said that Herr Righelli made his best silent pictures.Consequently, \"L'Innamorata\" does not have spectacular scenes of masses set in the old Roman Empire nor Herr Caesar or other such prominent figures. On the contrary, \"L'Innamorata\" is set in contemporaneous Italy by changing the Coliseum for the big city and crowds for modern masses. It deals with idle and decadent bourgeoisies; in particular Caesarine, Frau Mara Flores, a man eater without morals likes to toy with men.During the first part of the film we see the dissipated life of Frau Mara and her particular relationship with men. There are no attachments and she has a fondness for partying every night in elegant clubs. In one of these she will get to know an electrical engineer, Herr Carlo, who desperately falls in love with her but will have a tragic ending because Frau Mara uses him for her own interests. Namely she meets Herr Carlo's future brother-in-law, Herr Franco Arnaldi, who as Carlo's works in the same and modern power plant.But, unlike Carlo, Herr Franco Arnaldi is a dutiful and responsible man who only lives for his work and the care of his mother and sister. So, Frau Mara will have a taste of her own medicine.Now, for the first time in her life, frivolous and nonchalant Frau Mara is deeply in love. After much insistence, Frau Mara will light the sparks between them (an easy subject this due to the fact that Herr Franco works in a power plant?!) And then modern melodrama appears, especially at the end of the film. However, with the picture, everything is settled in an actual context. It's a contemporary drama than only shares with the early Italian classic film classics on thing: the affected performance of Frau Italia Almirante Manzini.\"L'Innamorata\" is an impressive technical accomplishment and visual and narrative innovation for these early silent days. It includes medium shots, close-ups and sequences in movement, besides many outdoor scenes in the country and in the city thus achieving a remarkable paced visual film narrative.Due to its bold and decadent story, the film was censored in Italy. However, this Herr Graf thinks that this was due to the fact that Frau Mara hadn't yet learned the habit of removing the hair of her underarms in the picture, and certainly that was a very good excuse for the censors, ja wohl!.\"L'Innamorata\" script was written by Herr Augusto Genina, who is well-known in silent circles for have been directed our beloved Frau Louise Brooks in one of her last films, \"Prix De Beaut\u00e9\" (1930).Summing up, \"L'Innamorata\" is an innovative early Italian silent film in comparison with the other more classical pictures produced at that time in that European country. It achieves for Herr Righelli a contemporary film that wisely updates classic melodrama elements in a modern context.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must ask to one of his rich Teutonic heiresses to pay the Schloss electric bill.", "language": "None", "country": "Italy", "poster": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.9", "type": "movie"}
