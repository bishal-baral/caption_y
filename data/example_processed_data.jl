L'INNAMORATA aka L'orizzontale Part one In the house of Mara Flores The Prince( Alfonso Cassini) The Lady?- She's in the bathroom... There are at least two hours of waiting, right? I'm afraid it is so. Mara Flores( ITALlA ALMlRANTE MANZlNI) My love, please, for heaven's sake... Do not put makeup on like that, each day more! My friend, please, for heaven's sake... Try not to be so grouchy, each day more! Jealous man! You still love your Mara? The Prince has arrived... I can not go out with you, the Prince is waiting for me... he wants to take me to the theater. So much worse for the old man! Tell him what you please! I do not care at all! But why persist so with a woman so senseless? She does not love anyone! She has no heart! But I, instead, I have plenty of heart! What can you do, this is my destiny! In the Garden of Wonders. Carlo Valderi, engineer.( ALBERTO COLLO) Tell the gentleman sitting at that table that I am not a circus freak, to be looked at in that way! That he be so kind to stop jesting! The sun does not protest when this humble flower stands to contemplate it... Because such beautiful star it does not want to imitate. Engineer C. Valderi I'm not a star and you're not a sunflower... I really like, however, men of spirit... Do you want to be one of ours? Love fills the last goblets with his portentous filter. Three in the morning. Good night, lucky mortal! On the threshold of Paradise... TO BE CONTlNUED PART TWO Villain! Why you never bring me to the theater? Tomorrow at four o'clock in the afternoon I will go with my mother to visit the new power plant, built by my brother. Could I meet you there? I wish to see you, but I have little hope. Orietta Arnaldi The next day, in the hall of the large power plant. Orietta Arnaldi.( M. GAUDENZl) Franco Arnaldi, engineer.( ANNlBALE BETRONE) His mother and his brother, an engineer, a close friend and direct superior of Carlo Valdieri. Authorized personnel only. The ladies are the mother and the sister of the Director. The law must be equal for all. I'm in a hurry, and I want to go through! Do not insist, do me a favor! Do not force me to be vulgar with a lady! You can boast about what you did to me! I spent a hellish night! Really? What a pleasure! Give me a cigarette! Oh! Then you're an engineer who works at the power station? If your heart loved me a little, mine would not suffer so much... Of course, Mom is right! He is a man without a will! If he were to give energy... to the power plant, then we would be really in good hands! In the evening. But you know that your manager is a true savage? Who, engineer Rinaldi? And why? You must forgive him, he's a man of great value, and lives only for his machines,.. and the love for his calculations,.. his world is as small as big is his intelligence. No women, no theater and no clubs. TO BE CONTlNUED PART THREE Prince, I am surprised at your behavior! A worldly man like you doesn't enter thus, without being wished! Didn't you see that the gentleman was about to kiss me? Mother, did you see Valderi? Who will be that lady who is with him? Orietta, you should not look at people this way! You know what? I saw Valderi with a...- With a...- With a... lady of pleasure! Shame on you! What a word! What an imagination! It couldn't be anything but... a cousin! It's Carlo's ruin! He is lost, and I lost my only friend! Arnaldi was not mistaken. I take the necklace: the first one hundred thousand francs at thirty days, and the others at three months. Agreed? For whom did you pretty up so?- For you! TO BE CONTlNUED PART FOUR My dear Prince,\" one always returns to one's early days\". I am free! I got rid of Valderi. Tomorrow night, great dinner at my house to celebrate my regained freedom... The downside. I can not wait! By ten o'clock tomorrow, the balance of the promissory note, or its protest. It is absolutely useless any request for a new expiry... Good evening, Orietta.- My brother is still there?- Yes! Then tell him it's late! And you? Have you already forgotten me? Yes... it is just so... you've already forgotten me... And to say that I... No! No! I will not tell you how much I love you... not even by phone! Mara! Go... soon! I drink to my true first- last love! Valderi is dying... because of your fault. He's waiting to tell you goodbye. Come! Come along, if you wish. I'm going with the gentleman! Out of here! The poor man killed himself because of your fault! On the way back. So you suffer a lot? I even feel the horror of not suffering enough! TO BE CONTlNUED PART SlX Do not annoy me! Prepare immediately the dress to go out! Never a woman in love managed to get ready so well! The first shadows... The first lights... I knock humbly on your door. It will stay closed or will it open? Your answer will be my destiny! I can not. I have no time! Excuse me. What do you want from me? I want you! I loved you! I love you! It is useless! I'm leaving. Farewell! You love me... you love me! You love me? Two months later. Away from the city. Preparations for the return trip. Greetings. And since the air of this place has been a medicine so effective for Orietta, thus I advise you to take advantage of it in your turn... I live here in the hope of your visit, amongst my books at home, and my machines in the workshop... TO BE CONTlNUED PART SEVEN The house and the books... Life had revealed her aspect of peace, and with Mara, as if by miracle, more intense seemed to him the blooming of spring... Someone who had known her very well... It's Mara!- Hush! She is with her engineer! Mara in love? Do not talk nonsense! She may well want to receive the tributes of an old friend! I think you're mistaken, sir! You think then that it ends thus, in laughing? Oh! Why can't we kill the creature we love, and then resurrect it with a virgin body and a new soul! The Triumph of Death Yes! Yes, you're right... But what do you want from me now? If I love you so... immensely... It is needless to dwell! I want to show that proud little woman how to treat old friends! Ms. Flores has charged me to repeat that she does not know you, and that in all cases, she has no wish to meet you! It is useless! I'm at your disposal! So much fear for so little. See? He soon realized it was no use to insist and went away! But, soon as alone, desperate and afflicted, she runs to her old friend's house! I fear a duel. Franco won't tell me anything. For the love of God, inquire... At dawn... Is it a serious situation? Where? You must tell me where is the place of the duel, and I want to find him, cost what it may! Seven in the morning... To my mother, in the case of my death. What has happened to my son? Franco! Franco! Where is my son? As you see, I always tried to protect your son from the accusations of the Board of Directors, but now it is no longer possible. It is thus necessary for him to return to work, and to leave the woman who will drag him more and more irremediably towards ruin... I'm not there for anyone. He went out? And you don't know where he went? No, ma'am. What do you still want from my brother? Where is Franco? If you know it, say it now, for Heaven's sake! A duel? TO BE CONTlNUED PART ElGHT Speak! I am her mother! I want to know the whole truth! But I loved him! I thought I would give him happiness! Oh! Madam! Here is your love! Here is your happiness! You here! In my mother's house? You're right!.. Forgive, madam, all the harm I've done him, and do not condemn me... And the beautiful illusion had thus vanished forever. Thank you very much, my friend, for your loving words, but for me can no longer be there any solace! My dear Franco, I have seen crying your mother, I got the news of your downfall, and I pondered! Franco, it is necessary for you to return to think about your work! I myself want your salvation. I myself want to take you back to the workshop!... And so it was. Franco obeyed to her whims, and followed her in those stern places, as he once had followed her on the path of pleasure. No, Franco, this love must have the image of a smile. You must work. It's early, my love, stay a little longer here with me... Do you love me? You'll love me forever? Even when I'm dead? Even if I were no longer beautiful? Forever! Forever! Why are you crying? Not at all! Not at all... It's over already!

This was primarily in two film different film genres in which the Italians achieved great artistic supremacy and merits: epic historical silent films and melodrama.Although \"L'Innamorata\" (1920) has nothing in common with these two classic film genres, what makes this early Italian silent picture special is precisely its modernity.The film was directed by Herr Gennaro Righelli who has a prolific silent career working in many Italian film companies and even he had a successful career in Germany where silent elders said that Herr Righelli made his best silent pictures.Consequently, \"L'Innamorata\" does not have spectacular scenes of masses set in the old Roman Empire nor Herr Caesar or other such prominent figures. On the contrary, \"L'Innamorata\" is set in contemporaneous Italy by changing the Coliseum for the big city and crowds for modern masses. It deals with idle and decadent bourgeoisies; in particular Caesarine, Frau Mara Flores, a man eater without morals likes to toy with men.During the first part of the film we see the dissipated life of Frau Mara and her particular relationship with men. There are no attachments and she has a fondness for partying every night in elegant clubs. In one of these she will get to know an electrical engineer, Herr Carlo, who desperately falls in love with her but will have a tragic ending because Frau Mara uses him for her own interests. Namely she meets Herr Carlo's future brother-in-law, Herr Franco Arnaldi, who as Carlo's works in the same and modern power plant.But, unlike Carlo, Herr Franco Arnaldi is a dutiful and responsible man who only lives for his work and the care of his mother and sister. So, Frau Mara will have a taste of her own medicine.Now, for the first time in her life, frivolous and nonchalant Frau Mara is deeply in love. After much insistence, Frau Mara will light the sparks between them (an easy subject this due to the fact that Herr Franco works in a power plant?!) And then modern melodrama appears, especially at the end of the film. However, with the picture, everything is settled in an actual context. It's a contemporary drama than only shares with the early Italian classic film classics on thing: the affected performance of Frau Italia Almirante Manzini.\"L'Innamorata\" is an impressive technical accomplishment and visual and narrative innovation for these early silent days. It includes medium shots, close-ups and sequences in movement, besides many outdoor scenes in the country and in the city thus achieving a remarkable paced visual film narrative.Due to its bold and decadent story, the film was censored in Italy. However, this Herr Graf thinks that this was due to the fact that Frau Mara hadn't yet learned the habit of removing the hair of her underarms in the picture, and certainly that was a very good excuse for the censors, ja wohl!.\"L'Innamorata\" script was written by Herr Augusto Genina, who is well-known in silent circles for have been directed our beloved Frau Louise Brooks in one of her last films, \"Prix De Beaut\u00e9\" (1930).Summing up, \"L'Innamorata\" is an innovative early Italian silent film in comparison with the other more classical pictures produced at that time in that European country. It achieves for Herr Righelli a contemporary film that wisely updates classic melodrama elements in a modern context.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must ask to one of his rich Teutonic heiresses to pay the Schloss electric bill.", "language": "None", "country": "Italy", "poster": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.9", "type": "movie"}
{"title": "The Three Musketeers", "content": "THE TREE MUSKETEERS Life knows no age nor time. Youth will ever set out to seek fortune. Man will ever fight for the love of a woman. Kings will threaten- Queens weep- Ministers conspire. And so- though our story is of three hundred years ago, It is as young as Yesterday or To- morrow. Then follow us to France of old. To frery days when hearts beat high, When blood was young, and hate was bold. When sword crossed word to dare and die. For love and honor gloried then. When live was live, and men were men! In 1625 the Court of France teemed with plot and counterplot, faction and cabal, enmity and jealousy- its men and women merely pawns in a game. Louis Xill, the King, jealous, suspicious, easily moulded--- Cardinal Richelieu, the Prime Minister, iron willed, bent on being the sole power to dominate the King... In another room in the palace... Anne of Austria, Queen of France, whose influence over the King is the one obstacle in Richelieu\u2019 s path to power... Constance Bonacieux... Seamstress to the Queen... Milady de Winter... Father Joseph, the familiar of the Cardinal, fearsomely know as His Grey Eminence... Madam my Queen I hear again how cruelly the Cardinal persecutes you. I pray you let me come to you that I may throw around you the protection of the love you have ever scorned Your mort humble slave Bnechingham In England, the Duke of Buckingham, whose mad infatuation for the Queen of France offers Richelieu the means for accomplishing his purpose\u2026 Madame my Queen I heard again how cruelly the Cardinal perseruter you. I pray you let me come to you that I may throw around you the protection of the love you have ever scorned Your mort humble slave Bnechingham Monsieur le Cardinal, your medicine. The Queen has but now received a letter from Buckingham I thank thee, Joseph. That is very stimulating. Your Queen is in danger. Your queen is in danger- menaced by a knight. Why do you harp on my Queen? What do you mean? I but spoke of your CHESS queen, sire. Always double meanings. Speak out, I command you. What shall I say of the Queen save that she is profoundly devoted? Devoted! To whom? Not to me. She is in love with Buckingham! I cannot but thing you are wrong, sire. If it were true, letters would have passed between them. Letters! We shall soon see. Madame, it is imperative that I see all your papers at once! Your Eminence was right. There was a letter. Nothing about Buckingham. Plenty about you. To monsieur my Brother The King of Spain The humiliations put upon me by this odious Cardinal are becoming the gossip of every court. I beg you send an emissary to urge his dismissal Your good sister Anne R Your Majesty knows that I have always warmly defended the Queen. If she distrusts me I must bear it with humility. In Tarbes, a town in the southern province of Gascony--- An impoverished nobleman sends forth his son to seek his fortune. D'Artagnan Remember, my son, that your ancient nobility gives you the right to the best in France. You have thews of iron and wrists of steel. Fight on all occasions! Fight the more since duels are forbidden, for that means double courage. Never forget these things- loyalty to the King- reverence for the Cardinal- devotion to the Queen-... and my pride in you... my love for you. In Paris... fresh intrigue... Milord Come to Paris that I may say to you what I dare not intrust to a letter Repenting the impulse that led to the humiliation of the Queen, the King strives to make amends... It took ten years to collect and match those twelve stones. They cannot be duplicated. And the world says kings and queens are not happy! I have come at a propitious moment to secure your signatures to a decree. And D'Artagnan little realized, as he leisurely made his way toward Paris, that he was soon to be enmeshed in a scandal involving the foremost courts of Europe. What we do now promise is by our concurrence and consent. Luis Milord Come to Paris that I may say to you what I dare not intriest to a letter. Anne Meet Milady de Winter at Meung. She is to deliver this letter to Buckingham and remain in England until I send for her. D'Artagnan takes every smile for an insult... every look as a provocation... The Inn at Meung... The exact shade of a buttercup! The color is common enough in botany but... until now... very rare among horses. Who laugh at my horse... laughs at me. Pardon me, Madame. I must kill your friend. To Buckingham without delay... by order of Cardinal. Coward! Thus chance left these two men with a score unsettled... but they were to meet again. Paris... A horse for a hat. Bonacieux, uncle to Constance... Can you tell me where I might and lodgings? Thus fate plays her part again... Pardon me, mademoiselle. Do you live in this house or that house? Marvelous! I desire to secure lodgings here. In England... Buckingham receives the forget letter... Milord Come to Paris that I may say to you what I dare not intrust to a letter Anne R The letter has been delivered, madam. In Paris, the next morning, D'Artagnan calls on his father's old friend, the Captain of the King's Musketeers... Monsieur de Treville, Captain of the King's Musketeers... The ambition of his life... to be one of this... Athos! Porthos! Aramis! You Know that fighting is prohibited yet you fight... fight... fight! And always with the Cardinal's Guards. But if you MUST fight... fight as you did yesterday. The three best swordsmen in Paris. So you are from Gascony... and the son of my friend. What hat brought you to Paris? I came to join the Musketeers. My boy, these Musketeers are all picket men. All my life I've dreamed, I've hoped, I've prayed to be in your regiment. Impossible! Serve your apprenticeship with the cadets for two years... and... we shall see. My man of Meung! Excuse me. I am running after someone. You can find ME without running. Do you understand? Where? Behind the Luxembourg. When? One o'clock. Behind the Luxembourg. Permit me to observe, monsieur, that in one respect you are absolutely perfect. You are the most perfect idiot I have ever met! Behind the Luxemburg at one o'clock. Possessed of Gascon courage, D'Artagnan wasted not a moment in regret that his first day in Paris had involved him with the three best blades of the time. Behind the Luxembourg at one o'clock... Gentlemen, I desire to explain... If you kill me, I shall have been honored... If I kill you, I shall regret it all my life... for I love you every one. Monsieur Athos, on guard! The Cardinal's Guards! Hola! We are in luck! You are under arrest Come and take us! We are four against three! Pardon, Messieurs. Four against Foul! A young Gascon played me foul. I'll find him and carve him to ribbons. My young harpooner, perhaps you'll arrange time for me to show you how to use a sword correctly. That is Bernajoux... the Cardinal best swordsman. One for all and all for one. Thus D'Artagnan, in two days, became the talk of Paris and won for himself the loyal comradeship that was to last throughout his life. Richelieu lodges complaint that the King's musketeers have assaulted his guards... Remember! I cannot have the Cardinal annoyed. Those who disobey the edicts must be... punished. Rest assured, Monsieur le Cardinal, these men shall be dealt with... properly. I commanded you to fetch me these four devils who have so maltreated seven of the Cardinal\u2019 s best men. Where are they? But where is that young cadet? You rascal... you have kept the King waiting! So you are that wild Gascon who fights a regiment single- handed? For the future I shall expect you to be discreet. But TOO discreet. I have a servant for you... a fellow who reflects before he acts. I found him on a bridge, spitting in the water to see which way the river was glowing. Your province? Picardy. As Richelieu's plans begin to mature, Constance makes ready to keep a mysterious appointment... Certain messages have been confided to you. Tell me what they are and to whom they are to be delivered. I dare not delay. Midnight is striking. It is the hour I am expected. Do not question me. My mission is secret. Who is he? Stop, in the name of heaven! His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham. Lead on. I'll follow. If anyone looks at you I shall kill him. The river entrance to the palace... Milord, you have been told that it was not I who wrote to you... yet you rashly insist on this interview! What does it matter? Nothing matters but that I see you again. You see me at the risk of my honor... rat the risk of your life. So sweet a voice can never pronounce the words that separate us.... the depth of seas,... the enmity of kingdoms...... the sanctity of vows! I beseech you... relent. Then something for remembrance... something that you have worn... a ring... a chain... a brooch... that I may wear it always. And now, Madame, your Majesty and I share a secret. The last of the King's gold... Richelieu prepares to make use of the Queen's secret... How many days away is the court ball? Twelve. Go to England. Deliver this to Milady de Winter. While poverty still stalks the four friends, Aramis has secured for himself an invitation to dine... Father, I have a friend I know you'll like. He's outside now. May I Bring him in? I trust I am not intruding. Father, I have a friend outside... a fine fellow. Monsieur de Cardinal, YOU always win! When I have bent my energies to a purpose, I have never failed. D'Artagnan invites his friends to dine... I wagered D'Artagnan that he could not provide a dinner without money. Does he think Paris is paved with food? Patience, my friends. This Gascon has a fashion of winning his wagers. Certain fortune favored members of the Cardinal\u2019 s Guards are gathered for a feast... Marvelous! Intruder! How dare you meddle with our dinner! Pardon, monsieur. MY dinner. I would allow you to get your swords, but... really, Messieurs... the dinner is not worth it. Porthos must pay. While in the palace, the Queen, who has been to a fancied security, receives a rude awakening. Madame, I wish to remind you that the court ball is only six days away. I request you to honor me by wearing to it the diamond buckle I recently gave you. This is the end! I am lost! Ten minutes later Constance arrives at home... Can I trust you? I love you. As rivers love the sunlight. Are you sure? I would give my life for you. This may mean your life. Go to England. Get the jewels from the Duke of Buckingham and return in all haste. The Queen's happiness, her life, her honor are in your hands. When you come back. Find Porthos and Aramis and me at De Trevilles. Bonacieux sells his information... Search Paris. If D'Artagnan is within the gates, fetch him to me. On perilous expeditions of this kind you must pay toll. Four must start if one is to arrive. All for one and one for all! Be at the Barriere du Nord in half an hour. See that the way to Calais... and beyond... is made unsafe. His Eminence presents his compliments and desires to see you at your earliest convenience. At your EARLlEST convenience. D'Artagnan is below. When I drop this handkerchief... fire. You were about to leave Paris, Monsieur D'Artagnan? We can make it VERY COMFORTABLE for you in Paris. It is imperative that I go. Monsieur D'Artagnan, if you were about to die, what would you do? Your Eminence, I should write the history of France. And what would you say? I should speak of her great men, Monseigneur. Whom do you call great? Monsieur le Cardinal, Duc de Richelieu. And what would you write of him? That he is a great statesman...... a great poet...... a great swordsman. You, yourself, are somewhat of swordsman. By the way... what trick you employed to best my man, Bernajoux? Thus four men rode forth in the service of their Queen... That is D'Artagnan. Porthos pay toll... An inn near Calais... Athos pay toll... The port of Calais from which D'Artagnan plans to sail... NOTlCE THE PORT IS CLOSED AVlS LE PORT EST FERME The port will remain closed until you receive further orders from the Cardinal. It shall be as you say, Count de Rochefort. My man of Meuhg! You are on the Queen's business, master. In England... Buckingham wears a buckle set with twelve diamonds. Let possession of this and fetch it to me at once. Richelieu Good! Say to His Eminence that I am attending the Duke's fete to- morrow night. Under the cover of midnight... Watch every boat for my return and have the horses ready. Set sail for England this instant or I'll blow out your brains! My heart fails me. Ever foot of this road is sown with danger. I'll stake my life he is near the shores of England at this moment. You love him? The fete at the palace of the Duke of Buckingham... To the harbour. That is Milady de Winter. Milady de Winter has just left your house... bound for the harbour. She is a friend of Rochefort, a tool of Richelieu. She has the jewels! The boat leaves in half an hour. Perfect! After you leave Calais, go by way of Boulogne. This ring will get you fresh horses along that route. Next morning... just before the ship drops anchor at Calais... We go by the long route. No food, no sleep, no rest until we reach Paris. The inn near Calais... Has Monsieur D'Artagnan passed this way? Then he has gone by the longer road. We can reach Paris ahead him. Drive on. The evening of the court ball... You bungler! I place the resources of a Kingdom at your command and you fail. Imbecile! Guard every entrance to Paris. Line the streets. D'Artagnan must not pass. Go to the ball. Join the Queen... never leave her for an instant. Block every way that leads to the palace. Arrest that seamstress, Constance. D'Artagnan... dead or alive! The grand ball room of palace... Her Majesty is late. I trust she will not forget that you desired her to wear your gift of jewels. At the gates of Paris D'Artagnan scents danger... Our luck runs too high. I smell the Cardinal. Madame, why do you appear here without your diamond buckle? Sire, I feared some accident might befall it. You do wrong to slight my wishes! This is Fate! This is for Meung... and this for Constance! Your Queen. My brave D'Artagnan, let this token ever remind you that you have won the eternal gratitude of a Queen. Constance has disappeared. Joseph, I never acknowledge defeat, I make use of it. If you were about to die, what would you do? Your Eminence, I should still write the history of France. Then set down in your book, Monsieur D'Artagnan, that Richelieu was a generous foe. Marvellous! And now, Monsieur D'Artagnan, what say you to a lieutenancy in my Guards? Your Eminence, my dreams, my hopes, my ambitions are all with the Musketeers. I am offering him a commission in my Guards. A commission in the King\u2019 s Musketeers. And so, later in the evening, De Treville presents to the King a new Musketeer...' D'Artagnan!

Whatever you want to do on your spare time is your business, as long as you don't ask me to spank you, we're all good. Great. Ah, you like that?( Eric whistle)( German accent): Mistress Henrietta awaits your arrival in the operations center. Those who are tardy will be subjected to severe punishment. Unless punishment is something you desire. No, not you. Sorry. Just role- playing. Oh, I get it. The, uh, tech nerd can't play with the cool kids. What? Man... Good morning, all. Miss Jones. An hour ago Monica Davis was the intended target of a shooter in Hollywood. CALLEN: Nice little serpentine move. Yeah, she's bobbing and weaving like she's used to getting shot at. Who is she? Miss Davis is a hostess at the Afrobeat nighclub N'Kosi. CALLEN: Why is someone trying to kill her? We don't know. And we weren't able to get a clear angle of his face. We're not sure, but he may be involved with this man. NELL: Johannes Waaldt. He's the owner of N'Kosi, where Monica works. He's also the face of several charities that build water purification systems in Africa. Am I missing something? ERlC: Back in the day, Waaldt was quite the international arms dealer. CALLEN: And that would be it. That's Abdul Habaza. The man who killed Moe. HETTY: From helicopters to rocket launchers, JoJo was a one- stop shop until he became a legitimate businessman. So what happened, Monica Davis saw something she wasn't supposed to see? HETTY: We're not sure. And we've lost contact with our man inside. Who's that? Deeks? ERlC: Not Deeks. Max Gentry. How long's he been working this? HETTY: This is a question for Assistant Director Granger. Apparently he set this up. Well, what is Deeks saying? He hasn't checked in yet. We're still waiting for his call.( laughing): Oh, my God. That was crazy. That dude could've killed me. Oh, you got that part, did you? And then you squeal in like freaking Steve McQueen from and I'm, like, get me the hell out of here. And you're, like, bang, bang, bang,( screeches) getting all Fast Five with it. Was that, like, insane, or what? No, that wasn't like insane, that was actually insane. I know, right, just feel my heart. Seriously, baby, feel my heart. No. Why are you so mad?' Cause you almost got yourself killed. But you saved me. You... are such a badass. Come one, baby, come here. Don't, stop. Just stop. Just relax, Max. We got away; we're home free. Are you kidding me? Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in? I'm not afraid of JoJo. You should be. Honestly, I can't even believe you did this. Well, what did you expect me to do? Uh, maybe what I told you-- you go in, you take some pictures. It was that simple. But when opportunity knocks... Yeah, well opportunity's about to kick open that door and shoot us both in the head.( mocking): Somebody's about to kick in that door and shoot us both in the head. Really? You joking?( mocking): You joking? Are you done? Max... chill out. You want to see them? No, I don't.( chuckles): Yes, you do. No, I don't. Put them back. I don't want to see them. Don't...( diamonds clattering) Oh, I just dropped a Bentley. Can you please just give those to me? Yeah. Just give... Don't put them down your... Are you... don't, you're gonna drop...( diamonds clattering) Ooh. Are you serious right now? You're dropping diamonds... This was a terrible idea. Deek's phone is still at his cover house. KENSl: All right, so why hasn't he checked in? SAM: Maybe he didn't have a chance yet. Yeah, but he's got to know we saw the shooting. If he was in trouble, he would've sent a distress. Not if he's injured or... dead. NELL: I got him. Deeks sent an encrypted text. Did he say what the hell happened? There's been a complication. Yeah, we've gathered that. CALLEN: What else? NELL: That's it. That's it? It was a short text. More of a tweet. He doesn't have a plan. KENSl: So what are we supposed to do, just sit around and wait until he comes up with one? No. Sam and I are gonna head down to Waaldt's club and we're gonna find out who we're dealing with. Okay, what am I supposed to do? Back up your partner. Are there surveillance cameras at the cover house? Uh, no. But he's got an earwig. We can send him a message, tell him to put it in. Do it. Send the address to my phone. Keep an eye on her. Will do. All right, you ready? We can't go to a club dressed like this. Why not? The club's not even open yet. Yeah, we still don't want to walk in there looking like a couple of hobos. Hobos? What is this, 1939? Yeah, we got to look the part. What, Hetty get you a new suit or something? You got a new suit? I'm due. I'm due. Why didn't she get me a new suit? Maybe she wanted to surprise you. Hetty? Am I, uh, getting a new suit? Not till you return the pants from the last one. I told you I can't find them. What is that? It was Armani Prive. I was under cover. Things happen. G, you lost your pants. Even Deeks doesn't lose his pants.( chuckles) Come on. We're lucky Deeks wears pants. I got to tell you, Hetty sure outdid herself this time. Don't even start. What, you don't think this is a sharp suit? Maybe it's because it's new. Do you remember before we were partners? Yeah, what about it? I miss those days. Yeah? Okay, Lone Wolf McQuade. Well, today, I'm an ex- running back, you're my agent, and we're here to rent the club for an NFL draft party. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How come I don't get to be the ex- player? As what, a kicker? Quarterback. I'm taller than Doug Flutie, I'm mobile... Fine, fine. We'll try it your way. But I'd still make a great quarterback. Yeah, just keep your pants on in there.( afrobeat music playing in background) Do you want the whole dance area? Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna want the, uh, VlP room, and we're gonna buy out the whole bar. WOMAN: Great, we can also do specialty drinks. CALLEN: I like it. This will work. You getting all this, Eric? Yeah. Waaldt we already know. Okay, our shooter's name is Pieter Smit. He's a South African native. Looks like he's worked security for everyone from Blackwater to drug cartels in Mexico and Bolivia. Who's the guy in the middle? ERlC: That is Noah Bernosoni. He's Swiss. NELL: He's an international banker, most recently with Wahr Geld Bank. Uh, graduated from London School of Economics. No criminal record. All right, keep digging. If he's dealing with Waaldt, he's probably into something dirty. ERlC: On it. And the bar is fully stocked. and it's all top- shelf. Great. Well, good. And we also provide the valet service until 1: 30. Anything later would have to be arranged beforehand. Appreciate you showing us around. Thank you. We'll be in touch. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe I'll have the two biggest ones made into earrings. What do you think? I think you should put them back in the bag before you lose them. Give them to me. Oh, gotcha! Just like Richard Gere in Remember the jewelry box that he snaps shut? Chomp. I love that movie. Yeah, it was a classic. Want to take a shower? No. No, I... don't. Well, suit yourself. Oh, my God. That's okay. I'll just get that-- that's fine. I'm here to clean. Oh, my God.( phone chimes) Hey! You're not going to run off with my diamonds, are you? Just take your shower. Last chance to join me. Yeah, no, I'm more of a bath guy myself. But thank you. Oh, that's romantic. I like that.( door closes)( beep) Are you there, God, it's me, Margaret. KENSl: Judy Blume, really? DEEKS: I got a softer side. Yeah, it's called your head. I missed you, too. Not from what I've seen. Oh, my God, are you jealous? Oh, please, if you want to keep an operation secret, that is your business. No, it wasn't a secret. It wasn't even an operation, all right? Granger wanted info on Waaldt so I went to Waaldt's club. I picked up his hostess and got her to look around for me-- that's it. And just like that, she agreed to spy on her boss for you? No, it took a little bit of persuading. I hope you used protection. DEEKS: It's not like that. The truth of the matter is that Max Gentry can be incredibly charming when he wants to be. Maybe I should be partnered up with Max. I didn't know she was going to go all Bonnie and Clyde on me. So, where is Bonnie? She's in the bedroom. I'm surprised you're not with her. You sound like her. What? Nothing. What the hell is going on? So I asked her to snoop around Waaldt's office. Guess what she found? Her panties? Meow, no not her panties. She found$10 million in diamonds. Who are you talking to? I- I was... I wasn't. I heard you. No, no, I was talking to myself. That's how I figure things out. You're so wound up. I'm fine. Everything's gonna be okay. I promise. You... you just need someone to take care of you. And, baby...... I'll take care of you.( kissing over earwig) CALLEN: How much we thinking? Well, it's hard to tell from the photos Deeks sent, but if they're real-- and there's no real reason to believe that they're not-- I'm guessing$10 million, maybe more. That's a lot of bling. NClS in Washington has seen a recent influx in blood diamonds. They're untraceable, won't set off any metal detectors, and you can carry millions- worth in your pocket. As long as they're real, no one cares where they came from. Our Red team has tracked blood diamonds from Sierra Leone to Antwerp where their county of origin papers are often forged. Other than Afghani heroin, blood diamonds have been the most consistent form of terrorist funding. So the big question is what is Waaldt funding?$10 million can fund a nice little coup. I thought he was out of the business. Granger must have had some suspicions to send Deeks in. Where's Granger? Oh, his office says he is unreachable. You told them what happened? Absolutely-- they said they would pass it along. We got nothing on this guy. NELL: Well... his man Smit tried to kill Monica Davis in broad daylight. Some jump- off tried to steal$10 million in diamonds from me, I'd off her in broad daylight, too.( laughs) Wow. That's good to know. Hypothetically speaking. If I were a bad guy. Uh- huh. It's attempted murder. You bring him in, maybe he gives his boss up. He's a violent dude. He's not the cooperative type. Which means we take a different tact. Which would be...? Something you don't need to know about. Hypothetically. Kens? Kensi, you out there? I know you can hear me. What? Where are you parked? Down the street. I can't even see you. That's the whole point of surveillance. Ah, well, I'm sorry you had to hear that. I guarantee it sounded worse than it actually was. Who cares? Oh, my God, I'm sure Sam doesn't act like this when Callen gets hit on. Act like what-- I'm just sitting here covering your ass. Not sure what she's doing with it. So, we're cool then? Why wouldn't we be cool? We should go to Monaco, you know? Like James Bond in It's Montenegro. You could get a tuxedo. Mm. And I'd get some hot dress. And we'd be drinking champagne and playing roulette. KENSl: No wonder she likes you. She's delusional. Okay, first off, actually happened in Montenegro, and secondly we're not going anywhere until we sort this out. Where's Montenegro? Yeah, Deeks. Where's Montenegro? It's in Europe. You have no idea. The beaches are topless. Look at that, she speaks Deeks. Match made in heaven. We'll could get you a sexy little Speedo. I'd pay to see that. People would pay to see that. I know I would. Tell her not to waste her money. It's too small a return on her investment.( Deeks and Kensi laugh) What? What's so funny? Nothing, I was just I was laughing the joke that... you just told. Oh, you never find my jokes funny, Maxi. Maybe that'cause you aren't funny. No, I do laugh at your jokes because you're very funny, you say clever things that are very funny.( phone ringing) It's my phone. It's Waaldt. Don't answer that. Why not? Because he can use that to trace us here. You're getting paranoid. Don't answer the phone! Hello? Not the brightest Barbie in the toy box, is she? Okay, that doesn't even make any sense. No, no, you listen. Yeah, I've got them, and if you want them back, you're gonna have to pay for them.( Waaldt speaks indistinctly) I'm not afraid of you.( Waaldt speaks indistinctly)( laughs) Whatever.( phone beeps) Hells, yeah, did you hear that? KENSl: I heard it. I definitely heard it. Did I sound like I meant business? Sounded like she just signed her own death warrant. Antagonizing him isn't gonna help anything. Screw him. Why are you acting so weird? I'm not. Are you getting cold feet? Because if you are, it's a little late for that. I mean, you knew Waaldt had diamonds. I didn't know he had diamonds. That's why you wanted me to snoop around. Don't pretend it's not. No, it wasn't. No, you wanted to know where they were so that you could steal them. But I stole them for you. You should be happy. And you should be thanking me. You and I... are gonna live happily ever after in luxury. Clearly delusional. So, I'm gonna get changed, and you and I can go out and celebrate. We're not gonna go out and celebrate. Yes, we are. No, we're not. Celebrate. Celebrate. Put your paws down. We're st... Oh, my God. Please help me. You brought it on yourself, Maxi. You're not helping. You are not helping. Are you hungry? No. Keep eating your bonbons.( chuckles) No origami today? No. And stop littering my dash. You're hungry. I know hypoglycemic- induced hostility when I see it. I'm just thinking. About what? You want to know what I was thinking? About eating? I was thinking about Wakanda. What is that, a camp in Wisconsin? Seeing Abdul Habaza's picture reminded me of Moe and Jada, the time I spent in Chad and Sudan. I started thinking about Wakanda. Where is Wakanda? It's nowhere. It's a fictional African country. The most technically advanced society in the Marvel Universe. And the richest. Hold on a second. In a comic book? You just geeked out on me in a real moment? Hey, man, when I was a kid, comic books were the only thing that made sense. It was simple-- good guys versus bad guys. For me it was all about T'Challa, the Black Panther. Of course. Not just'cause he was a brother who was richer than Tony Stark. T'Challa was a leader, he was a president, he was a superhero all at the same time. He was all about justice. When I left Brooklyn, the only thing I wanted to see was the motherland and- and to witness that world up close. But instead of finding Wakanda, I found poverty, starvation, child soldiers, death squads. Waaldt's bread and butter. I thought I could save Moe. I really thought I could help Jada. That whole motherland thing's overrated. I mean, look at me. I come from a line of blood- feuding gypsies who keep trying to kill me. How's that justice? There's our guy. You ready, T'Challa? See, I knew I shouldn't have said that to you.( laughs) I always regret it when I tell you things. I know you do. CALLEN: Hey. Can I bum a smoke? Thanks. Got a light? What kind of a smoker doesn't have a lighter? I'm trying to quit. Don't move. You have no idea who you're dealing with. Pieter Smit. Born December 19, 1972, Kroonstad, South Africa. Mother was Mary, father was also Peter. You served in... What do you want? We just want to talk. Not interested. Well, we can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way. Go to hell. That would be the hard way.( shouts over blow- dryer): Waaldt should've called back by now. KENSl: You don't have to yell. I'm not talking to you.( knocking on door) Hey. Stay in the bedroom. I'm closing this. Stay in the bedroom. Kens, somebody's here. Oh, you've got to be kidding me.( sighs) Hi. Who are you? Kelly Lang, neighborhood watch. We've gotten reports concerning some suspicious and lewd behavior coming from this residence. She's in the bedroom. Oh, where she does some of her finest work, I'm sure. Thank God. She's gonna hear you. Good!( clears throat) Callen and Sam have the guy that tried to kill you both. They think she might help turn him, and if Waaldt's traced her phone, the safe house is no longer safe. God, I hate this part. What, the part where you have to say everything was a lie? That you're a big fat liar? That part? Don't do that. Don't gloat. I'm not gloating. You're gloating a little bit. I wasn't gloating. It's a little unbecoming, actually.( knocking) Monica! Monica?( blow- dryer whirring) Where is she? No. Should have seen that coming. If I had known we were going swimming, I would have packed my swimming trunks.( chuckles) You're funny. He's funny. I don't think he's funny. Don't take that personally. He's only happy if he's hurting somebody. Good cop, bad cop? That's the best you got? I don't know. I mean, those are two of our better routines. What else do we have? We have the girl he tried to kill. We have the girl. Which one? There's been a couple got away, but not many. Now that's funny. No? Tough audience. I'll tell you what else we have. We have... your boss's diamonds. Congratulations.( phone chimes) Hang out. We'll get more acquainted later. What do you got, Eric? Okay, it's all good, but Monica Davis escaped. How? Out a window, I think. And she's got the diamonds. And this is all good because...? Because we're tracking her cell phone and Kensi and Deeks are following her. She make any calls? Not yet. Keep it that way. Don't let her receive any incoming either. Let us know if Waaldt tries to reach her again. I'm on it. Any word from Granger? Nope. Of course not. Keep us informed. Will do. KENSl: Eric, how far now? Uh, she's about half a block ahead of you on the left. She's not moving. I can't believe she double- crossed me. Yeah, just when you were about to live your life happily ever after in She played you. She's actually not that bad. She just... Has poor judgment? Exactly. Like her taste in men. Oh, see? See, what you tried to do right there, but it's not gonna work' cause she wasn't actually involved with me. She was involved with my alter ego Max Gentry. Hang on a second. Not your undercover legend? You know, that's what I meant. No, no, no, you said alter ego. That's completely different. Superheroes have alter egos. No, no, superheroes have secret identities. Schizophrenics have alter egos, like Dr. Jekyil and Mr. Hyde. Or you when you haven't had chocolate or during your lady phase. Shut up. Ooh, speaking of crazy women. All right, stay here. Why am I staying here? Um, maybe because if she sees you she's gonna want to run again like most women. Except for you. You don't run from me. That's because I carry a gun. Now make yourself useful and back me up. I'll just be here holding your purse. Eric, call Monica's phone. On it.( phone rings) Yeah? Hello? Hello? I think they hung up. NClS. What? Too many letters? Federal agent. Back off, bitch. I mean it. Freeze! Max, what are you doing? Shoot her! Sorry, honey, he's with me. And his real name is Marty Deeks, and he's a cop, and he's my partner. Who's the bitch now? He is. Can't argue with that. CALLEN: Aren't you even a little bit curious as to why we brought you here? I'm assuming it's to kill me. That's just defeatist. What was your boss gonna do with the diamonds? A tiara. I think you got a smirk out of him. It was subtle. I mean, you'd have to know him better to see it, but... Look, I'm not gonna kill you. He might, but I won't. I don't even care about the diamonds. I just want to know what they were being used for. Ask my boss. I would, but he's not here, you are. And I'm not telling you anything, so you might as well go ahead and drown me. We're not gonna drown you. No, he still has to feed the fish. Did you see that? He smiled. Now he's happy. Finally.( metallic clattering) Okay. I guess I'll get some lunch. What are you thinking, fish tacos? I'm not hungry. Still? Hmm. How about you? He shouldn't eat. Hmm. Okay. All right, you let me know when you're all done. He was brokering a deal. I'm sorry? Waaldt was brokering a deal. The diamonds were payment. For what? I don't know. Who's the buyer? I don't know. Is it Bernosoni? The guy from the club today? No. Bernosoni was negotiating for the seller. Who's the seller? I don't know. You don't know much, do you? I know he was Russian. A Russian is selling something for$10 million? How do you know the seller was Russian? Because he was speaking in Russian. When? A few weeks ago he came by the club one time. You saw him? Yeah... I saw him. The Russian you saw with Bernosoni... he one of these guys? That one. That's him. SAM: Isaak Sidorov. What kind of police station is this? The kind you don't ask about. Sit! Seriously, you're not gonna say anything? I got nothing to say. Yeah. Yeah.( door closes) What's he doing here? Same thing you are. Next time I won't miss. Shut up and keep moving. The diamonds she stole were to broker a deal with Isaak Sidorov. Are you kidding me? Who's the buyer? CALLEN: Smit doesn't know. Well, did anybody recognize Sam as David Forman or mention Quinn? No. Their covers are intact. Picked Sidorov out of a photo array. Said Sidorov meet face- to- face with his boss, Waaldt. Holy crap, this is huge. Okay, so what do we do now? We make a plan... and fast. CALLEN: Johannes Waaldt was brokering a deal with Bernosoni using$10- million worth of blood diamonds to buy one or more of Sidorov's nuclear bombs for an unknown buyer. I'd bet more like$12 million. What's a couple of million dollars amongst friends, huh? Well, Waaldt's gonna need some serious coin to cover that kind of loss. You know, by now, he must be wondering where Smit is. Maybe we can convince Waaldt that Smit and Monica stole the diamonds together. DEEKS: I know somebody that can make that story stick. You think she'll play ball? She won't want to, but she'll do it. I told you things I never told anybody else. We did things I never did with anybody else. I'm sorry, but that wasn't me. That was Max. I risked my life for you. I never asked you to steal the diamonds. Well, you took advantage of me. As I recall, you're the one that tried to rip me off. I thought you were getting cold feet. I was doing that for us. Just to be perfectly clear, I never forced you to do anything. Keep telling yourself that. So what now? So what now is, you have a choice. This is your third strike. Yeah? And you stole millions of dollars of merchandise, you assaulted a federal officer. And with your record, you're looking at 25 to life. Oh, just cut to the chase. Just tell me the truth for once. Work with us. Help us make the diamond exchange with Waaldt. And if it leads to his arrest, and the arrest of Sidorov, you get to walk away free. That's it? It's that simple. Oh, screw simple. What about a reward for the diamonds? I mean, they got to be worth something. God bless you. Always the hustler. Yeah, takes one to know one. Fair enough. Why should I believe a word you say?' Cause I'm the one telling you, not Max. Yeah. And your imaginary friend, Max Gentry, absolves you of all guilt.\" It wasn't me, it was Max.\" So lucky to have a friend like Max. Are you done? Yeah. So what's it gonna be, Monica? What do I have to do? DEEKS: Call Waaldt. You tell him it was Smit's idea, and he tried to kill you, he tried to double- cross you, and now you're scared. You tell him you have the diamonds, and you'll give them back for$100, 000 in cash. Give him an hour to meet you at the LA Music Center with the cash, or you'll find another buyer. Don't suppose I get to keep the cash after we're done? What do you think?( sighs) You can tell your buddies I'm in. But I'm asking Waaldt for$250, 000. I might be scared, but I'm not stupid. Love it.( sighs)( whispering inaudibly)( door opens, closes) She's all yours.( door closes) SAM: Kensi... Let him go. You're up, Kens. Tuck. You know, you have a pretty sweet right cross. Thanks. I can tell you've studied Krav Maga. You know, I used to have a thing for buff Israeli guys. You know what I was thinking? What? That you and I should take off with the diamonds. We'd make a pretty sexy team, and no one would mess with us. And I'd cut you in for half. That was a joke. So... I got Max Gentry, but you get the real deal. How's that? Deeks is my partner. And that's it? That's enough. Is it? You know you can't trust him. I trust him with everything. You're a bigger fool than I thought. Everything he did, he did it to establish his cover. A cover that saved you, and that will save a lot of other lives. I'm not worried about the past. Any of it. I mean, why would you be? You're just his partner, right? Bye. Good luck out there. Hmm. Any sign of Waaldt? I got nothing. Nope. Nope. Eric? Nothing yet. And Waaldt's phone is turned off, so we have no idea where he is. SAM: He's coming around the fountain. He's got a briefcase. Is that my money? Blunt and crass. What should I expect from a waitress? I was a hostess. You put the\" ho\" in hostess.( over earwig): And now you're a thief. It takes one to know one. Ooh, clever. Where are my diamonds? Okay, that's enough. Hey, hey. Don't tell me you're gonna count that. No, I trust you. Something I'll never do again. I'm not here alone. Neither am I. KENSl: Gun!( silenced gunshot) DEEKS: Monica!( gunshots, people screaming)( Waaldt cries out) Freeze! I got him! Monica! Monica! Stay down. You're okay. You're okay, just breathe. Just breathe.( groans)( panting) I would have been better off with Max.( groans, pants) Kens... Eric, I'm gonna need two ambulances. MONlCA: Oh...( groans)( distant siren wailing)( groaning) Hey. Hey, you're still here. Yeah. How come? I, uh... couldn't find you. You didn't pick up your phone. Must have left it in my car. Hetty wanted me to give you this. Okay. How's Monica? Um... She's sore. Obviously lucky. How's Waaldt? Waaldt lawyered up in the ambulance, and he hasn't said a word. Literally, a word. Well, maybe he'll change his mind. Yeah, who knows. So, I was... Listen, I... Sorry, go ahead, I wasn't... No, please. I was just gonna see if you were good. Yeah. You? I mean, I'm good if you're good. I'm good. Okay. Good. We're good. Which is, you know... great. Glad we cleared that up.

Otherwise you would be able to bank it. Oh, so you're the fucking tin expert suddenly, are you? No, no. I just... If I could just have it. Get your bloody hands off my tin. I'm sure if I can just. Get back, you little ponce! All right, calm down. What's going on? Agghh! Oh, my God! Help, help, help. Not the face. Help! Not the face. It looks like your eye is sort of growing a plum. Right, thanks for that, Grumio. You know, you should really report that guy. Well, I would, but you know, it's a bit embarrassing, because, you know, he was sort of older than me. Why is that embarrassing? Because he's much older. How much older? Well it's hard to say exactly. Yeah, but probably around 50 years... 50 years old or 50 years older? Hmm, yeah, older. He was in his seventies? Well, early seventies and he was very sprightly, to be fair to him. Oh, that's not cool. I'm not saying it's cool, am I? That's older than my nan and she needs help out the bath. Don't compare him to your nan, OK. This guy was a veteran, you know, he's a trained killer. Yeah, but trained when? Like ages ago? It doesn't matter, does it? Once you're trained, you're trained. What did Cynthia make of it? Well, she did dab my face. Hey, result! Yeah, but then she called me a poor lamb. Oh, no. I know. Of all the animals. No- one wants to fuck a lamb. I'm not sure I'm really cut out for this. For what? I don't know, life. Oh, come on, man, it will pick up. You know, one door closes and another door opens. You reckon? Because right now it's more like one door gets repeatedly slammed into my nuts.' Ey up. So, this is the dining room/ conference area. Those tiles may look cracked, but that's deliberate. That's actually a mosaic. Ah, landlord. Sorry! Oh, hello boys, all right? Yeah, fine. Sorry, who is this? Oh, yes. Allow me to introduce you to Irina. Lovely to meet you. Hi, hello, I'm Stylax. And what are those? Oh, and allow me to introduce you to bananae. It's a fruit. They're very popular back home. I'm trying to sell them here. Oh, amazing. Can I try a bit? Oh sure, of course. Hmm, that's gorgeous. Sorry? Sorry? What the hell is going on? So, if you'd just like to step into the bathroom/ study for a sec. Here, keep it. I have many. So what happened to your face, then? He got beaten up by an old man. Man! Just say man. Oh, dear. How old are we talking? Mid- seventies. It's not important. Why is that woman in our bathroom? Ah, well, Irina's from Thrace, which you may have heard we've just conquered. So now they're all flooding over here. To our flat? Yeah, well she just needs something temporary until her banana business gets going. I was gonna send her packing, but then I thought,' Hang on a minute. The boys might wanna hold onto her.' Ah, good thinking. Right, but for nothing? Oh, absolutely. It won't cost you a thing. No, I mean, we pay the same rent and have another person living here? Correct. So what's in it for us? Well, she is. You know what they say about Thracian women? No. What do they say? Dirty. Really? Oh, yeah, filthy in the bedroom. So what do you say? You interested? Yes, we are. No, thank you. A quick word if I may. Where would she even stay? We don't have a spare room. No, we don't need one, because, right, hear me out. I've thought this through. But how? We've only just met her. Yeah, but I've had this exact fantasy loads, right? And what we do is we give her my room and then I come in with you. Ah, no. No, no, we are not sharing a bed. Yeah, but we won't have to, not for long. Because, right, here's the genius bit. Oh, I'm glad there's a genius bit. There is. After, like, one or two nights me and her get it on and then I get my room back anyway. And what if she doesn't fancy you? What? One- she's filthy. Two- she does. Even you couldn't miss those vibes. I know you fancy her. She had you eating out of her hand, literally. I'm not cleaning up after someone else. I've got enough on my plate as it is. OK, look, look. Both of you, stop cock blocking me. I'm not doing that. I don't know how to do that. First, Cynthia's out of bounds. And now her. It's like you're a human chastity belt, mate. You won't rest till you've cut off my wang and locked me in a dungeon. OK, that is honestly not my long- term plan. I just don't wanna live with a random fruit seller from Thrace. Yeah, but, you know, she is exactly what this place needs. You know, a woman's touch. And fruit! And she's nice. OK, what are you basing that on? Irina, sorry. Yes? You're nice, right? Yes, very nice. Yeah. OK, well that checks out. Please let me keep the dirty Thracian. I'll look after her. Come on, man. Throw me a bone. No, I don't want to, I don't want to. I don't like the look of it. Just try a bit. You're trying to get it on my bloody face. Come on, just try a bit. Stay away from me! All right, chill out. I said I don't like it. Why is it penis- shaped anyway? You're penis shaped. What? No, I'm not. You are actually. I'm just standing up. An erect penis then. I do not look like an erect penis. Oh, I don't know, water boy. You are a bit of a prick! Water man. Copier, what's wrong with your face? Yes, he claims to have slipped. I did slip, it was an accident. Right, that sounds suspiciously like the sort of thing abused wives say. Has Shredder been abusing you? I would never do that. I clearly wouldn't be the wife out of me and him, so... No, you are so the wife. I'm pretty sure you are, mate. There's no way I'm the wife. Yeah, you are, you are, yes. Put your face away. It's ghastly. It's worse for me. Not really, you don't have to look at it. Pop it on the table, there's a love. You want me to? Pop it. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Right, OK. Oh, my good jove, Shredder, what are you doing? I'm eating a banana. It's a new fruit. Well now, that is glorious, isn't it? Can you get hold of one for me? Hmm, yeah, sure. Maybe I got you wrong, Shredder. Maybe you are the wife after all. Ha. It'll be like a slumber party. Having you in my bed is not a party and I doubt I'll get to slumber. Of course you will. I'll help you slumber. Just think of me as a big teddy bear. A big naked teddy bear with herpes. Oh, one or two nights? Max, two nights max. Wow, that's come up a treat, hasn't it? I'm not sure it's a treat, but... Well, it is for me. I feel awful. It was my fault you got duffed up in the first place. He didn't duff me up. He just caught me by surprise. Several times. Yeah, they're pretty stealthy these 90- year- olds? What? You said 70. Cynth said 90. Yeah, well he wasn't. Yeah, well we don't know. All right, Mets, leave him alone, he's a poor lamb. I'm really not a poor lamb. I just feel bad that Cynthia missed her audition. Oh, don't worry, I managed to re- arrange it for tomorrow. Oh, cool, I'll come with you. OK, great. Maybe wait outside just because of the whole... Yeah, will do. Oi, oi. I guess I could make my move on her tonight. Just sleepwalk into my old room and be like,' Oh, sorry, Irina, force of habit.' I don't think force of habit is a valid excuse for sexual assault. Yeah. She'll probably just invite me in anyway. Dirty minx. Where is she? She's here, right? Oh, yeah. And then some. How's my breath? Ooh! Hot and bananary. Perfect. Boys! Here she is. You are home. Oh, hi. Wow. Really? Hello! Oh. Yeah. Erm, what? This is my husband, Cosmo. Your... Husband. Cosmo! Ah, no. Great to meet you. We're going to have such fun time, huh? Two nights max! It might take a bit longer. Oh, you think? This wasn't part of your fantasy, then? The sexy new flatmate has a massive pony- tailed husband? Not really. It's bonkers our landlord never mentioned him, innit? Really bonkers, Grumio. Really battleship mental. Oh, come on, mate. Hurry up. Oh, I think this might be the finale. Hmm, might be doing an encore.- Oh, oh!- Ohhhh! All right? Pony tail is in there. Oh, God. I'm next. Oh, no, swap with me. No, thanks. Well, yes, thanks, Grumio. You're my slave. I didn't sleep, so please swap with me. Why didn't you sleep? Because of you, mate. What do you mean? I'm an ideal bedfellow. Are you? Yeah. Do you know you napsterbate? I do what now? You napsterbate. You sleep wank. Shut up! No- one's ever mentioned it before. No- one's ever hung around to find out. Did I get to the end? I didn't watch. You did, yeah. Ha, morning! All right. I have left anus cloth next to sink. Right, cool. What's an anus cloth? Do you mean my face flannel? Have a nice day. I'd leave that for a bit if I were you. OK, you can go first. I had no idea there was a husband. Well, I think you did. I think you lead us into a honey trap. How dare you. I did no such thing. You said Thracian women were dirty. They are very dirty, but also very faithful. That's a terrible combination. Not for the Thracian blokes. They bloody love it. We want the Thracians out of our flat. They're noisy and they leave their fruit everywhere. Ah, now you're being Thracist. What? No, I'm not. No, I'm not having Thracism in my building. Those guys have suffered. They've been invaded. And now we've been invaded. Exactly. Serves us right. The bottom line is, lads, you wanted her, you keep her. And him. Yeah, but for how long? You said this was temporary. Well, that depends on their banana business. I mean, if it takes off then so will they. Off you go, then. Ahem! Introducing bananae. The hip new yellow fruit snack that gives you energy and friends. Ooh, does it? Yeah. This hand- held superfood is this season's must eat for all thrillseeking execs. Ask Stylax for them now. Ah. You realise I can't put out an advertisement as a memo. It's not an advertisement. I'm afraid it is if you're telling people to ask Stylax for them now. OK. What about if we put a question mark at the end? So it was like,'Ask Stylax for them now?' Oh, yes, all right. Would you not like to mention their shape? Ah... no. No, you're all right. We meet at last. Shredder, do you mind? What's that? I don't want you looking at me when I'm eating it. Oh, right, shall I? No, stay. Just turn around. You have to peel it. I know, I know you have to peel it. They're high in energy and, erm, yellow. Sssh! Do you like them? Yes. Yes, I do. So, maybe if you order some more in. Oh, I will. This is exactly what the workforce need to defeat the mid- afternoon slump. Oh, big time. Shredder? What? Can you get me a shed load more? Don't take it personally. I don't. It's just dispiriting that so many auditions are fixed. By fixed you mean someone else gets the part? Yeah, exactly. Help our brave boys. Oh, Marcus, there he is. Oh, shit. Him? What? That frail old man there? He's deceptive sprightly. Can we just go please before he sees us? He won't see us. He's probably got cataracts if he's in his eighties. He's late sixties tops. Help our boys, sweetheart? I think I've already helped quite enough, thank you. Do you mind if I ask you how old you are, please? I'm too old for you, darling. I'm 79. He's basically 80. Seventies. He's in his seventies. Help our brave boys abroad, sir? Just get out my face, yeah. Oh, it's you. Oh, that's come up nice and shiny, hasn't it? Yeah, just piss off, you knob. Oh, so you're a tough guy now, are you? Ignore him, Marcus, just walk away. Yeah, that's right, Marcus. Jog on, mate. You got something to say, have you? You little pussy. Ohhh! What the hell did you do that for? He's an old man, you bloody psychopath. He called me a pussy and you were teasing me the whole time. So it's OK to deck him? Oh, I'm pathetic for being beaten up by an old man but I'm a monster for beating him up? What am I supposed to do? Neither. You're meant to do neither. Ah, come on. Ah, man, that's even less cool. I know. It went down really badly. Clearly the only thing worse than being attacked by an old man is attacking an old man. Well, so what am I meant to do if he really wants to fight me? You just wait it out. Just wait it out? What, until he dies? Yeah, that's what you do. You outlive him. I'm not even sure I would, mate. He was so fucking sprightly. Well, tonight why don't we try sleeping top and tail? I'm not worried about your top or your tail. It's that area there. Oi! Hello. Hiya. Is this our flat? Get off me. Grumio, why does our flat look like a community centre? They invited some more Thracians round. They were all right at first, then it all got a bit much. I'll say. It's bloody heaving. Stylax, come here. Come meet my sister Eva. This is my sister Eva. Hello. Hiya. My name's Stylax. Yeah. And her husband Gregor. Right, yeah. Sorry, Cosmo. Yeah? What's this? We have get- together. Well, can I... I've got some food I wanna cook. No, no. No space in kitchen. But we have food. What have you got? Banana fritter, banana cakes, a Thracian dish called galvinta, hmm. What's galvinta? Secret recipe. Banana- based? Yes. This my friend Carlotta. Hey. Hi. I'm Stylax. Pleased to meet you. And her husband Angelos. Yep, thought so. Mushroom. Mushroom, over here. What does that mean? For wrestling. They keep trying to get me to wrestle that slippery lad. Come on, Mushroom, he's only boy. And calling me Mushroom. And this is my cousin Petra. Her husband passed away recently. OK, cool. Stylax. Lovely to meet you. So she cannot touch a man for one year. Yep, obviously. Mushroom, Mushroom, Mushroom!- Oh, look.- Mushroom! Mushroom! Look at the Mushroom. Mushroom! Mushroom! Mushroom! Mushroom! Mushroom! Mushroom! You really should be able to take a 10- year- old boy, Grumio. There's no way that beast were 10. He were at least 12. I can't live like this. These people are awful. I'm not being Thracist. I just really want them out of my flat. Yeah, they'll be gone soon. A couple more big banana orders from work and they're out of here. Two days. Don't say it. Don't say anything. Don't speak to me ever again. This is a new fucking low. Oh, bloody hell. What's he doing? Mate, no! This isn't the toilet. Hello, Mushroom. Two days max. Water? Water? Oh, fuck! Aghh! The banana jacket is an accident waiting to happen. Except it's already happened. Right. OK, it's an accident waiting to happen again. Can you not just look where you're going, water boy? Not if I'm carrying the jug, no. Water man! These things are a health and safety nightmare. He just doesn't like them because they're shaped like a penis. It is not that actually. It isn't that actually. I insist you ban them or I will tell head office you're putting the safety of the staff at risk. I will. Fine, have it your way. No, wait. As of now, I am banning bananae. They are bananned. Do not bring them into the office. Now get out. Thank you for your time. But they're so tasty and hip. The deal is off, Shredder, I'm banning them. Immediately after I've had this last one. So that's that, then. We're basically stuck with these fuckers. Looks like it. But you know, it'll get better. Oh, it won't. Of course it will. After a time we'll adapt to their ways and customs and maybe even meet some single Thracian women who can be filthy and loyal to us. Make way! Shit, get down. Down. Halt! On me. Does Marcus Gallow live here? What do you want him for? The evil bastard attacked a veteran, put him in hospital. Any idea where he is? Oh, yeah, he's right in here. He's that one with the pony tail. Thank you. Come on, boys. These big oldies all come barrelling in, then one of them, like, flung him about by his pony tail. What was Irina doing? She was sort of squealing, but not like before. This were less sexy, more angry. And then they just left? Just packed their bags and buggered off. Awesome. Is it awesome, though, that we had an innocent guy beaten up? Yeah. He was really annoying. I'm not sure that's enough. Yeah, with all the kissing. And the wrestling. Did you see the size of his shits? They were bigger than me. I suppose it will be nice to have my bed back without the herpes- ridden teddy bear wanking in it. There you go. This couldn't be any better. Oh, they didn't leave any bananae, did they? No, sorry. But I did find this under the bed. What the hell is that? Haven't got a clue. It's worth a try, though, isn't it? Go for it.

{"title": "The Fosters Consequently", "content": "She got into a fight with her foster father? That's how she landed in juvie. This is for a few weeks, right? You're stealing my pills? What do you need all that money for anyway?- I've been talking to Ana.- Our birth mom? You know, I'm just trying to get back on my feet. Here.- Where are you going?- It's my brother. You're gonna get me sent back to juvie. And Jude is gonna be stuck in that house. Can I help you?- I was looking for the metro.- The Metro's a few miles from here. Whoa, hey! What the hell are you doing here?- I just want to talk to Jude.- No! Shut up! No! Freeze! Get down on your knees now! Hands on your head! We are not sending these kids back into the system.- We really don't have the room.- Then we'll make room. Jesus, the trash needs to go out. I shouldn't have to remind you.- I took them out yesterday.- Well, it's full again. And get off your skateboard, please. And, it's not because what you did last night wasn't really dumb. And I don't use those words for lack of bigger ones. It was really dumb. My God, what were you thinking? Running off, chasing after some girl. Come one. Even if it was to help her brother.- Why didn't you just call me?- I know, I know.. It was a big mistake. It could have been a fatal mistake, love, you had no idea what you were walking into. Could have been much much worse than that. I mean, it won't happen again. You're damn right it won't happen again. I gotta be honest with you, my friend. I was ready to drop the hammer. But after talking with Lena, we have decided that you are probably very aware- of the potential consequences of your actions, yes?- Yes. And this is pretty out of character for you, so we are not going to ground you, but I am telling you, this will never ever happen again. Hmm, where's Mariana? Oh, she's still in the bathroom. Mariana, come on! Let's go, babe. We've gotta eat.- Callie, can you put juice out for everybody?- Yeah. I didn't have time to do my hair. Well, it's too late now sweetie. We still have 15 minutes. No no no. You guys have to walk to school today. We have a thing. Come on. Come eat. I am not going to school with my hair like this. Well then you're not going anywhere, ever again. Stef, your pancakes are burning. Great. I get to spend all day looking like a***.***- Enough.- Ok, guys you have to be out the door in 10. Stef and I have a meeting with Bill. And then I'm gonna take Jude to come later to school, to show him around. He'll be ok. I promise. I'm not gonna let them split you two up again, ok? Yeah. All right, pancakes everybody. Who wants pancakes?***, you want pancakes? Brandon, pass them around, please. Ow! Ok, Jesus, how many times have we said, no skateboard in the house?- Have you taken your pill this morning?- Yes.- No.- No.- Jude, dude, come on.- Sorry. Some fruit, you guys. Let's do this!- synced and corrected by chamallow-- www. addic7ed. com- What are you doing? I didn't have time to dry my hair this morning. There were like 300 people in the bathroom. You look fine, I'm sure no one's going to notice. What happened to your hair? Jesus, you idiot! He may be an idiot, but damn your brother's so hot. Oh my God, ew. Hey, do you have any more you know what?- I only have a couple left.- No, and I can't get any more.- Really?- Really. Ok, see you babes at lunch. Bye. So, what happened last night with your birth mom?- Jesus found out.- He found out?- Did he freak?- Completely.- Did he go with you?- No. He yelled at me. So, how was it? Honestly? It kind of sucked. Well, at least you don't have to invite her to your quinceanera. That would've been awkward. Come on, we're going to be late. [ Stef ] Have you thought any more about what you want to do?- About Callie and Jude?- Mm. No. To be honest, I just keep thinking about seeing you and Brandon in that house with a gun...- We were fine.- I know you were fine. I know that. But in my mind, when you go to work, you are writing parking tickets and pulling cats out of trees.- That's firemen.- You know what I'm saying.- Don't insult me.- You know what I mean. I just keep flashing back to you storming into that house with your gun pulled out... It's what I do, love. I get this awful feeling in my stomach. And I cannot help but connect that back to Callie.- Meaning?- Meaning, I know that you said we're not going to put them back in the system but, I have some really serious concerns. [ Doorbell rings ]- That's Bill.- There's Bill.- [ Bell rings ]- Ok, bye.- Hey.- Hey, you... Ah, did I just see Callie down the hall? I don't know, did you? I'm just surprised is all. I mean, I figured after last night they would've...- Would've?- Sent her back to juvie, or another foster home or something. Yeah, well, they're not. I mean, not now, at least. Mm. Good.- You ok?- Totally. I'm fine.- You're sure?- Brandon, I'm fine. Are we still on for Friday? It's not every weekend my parents go out of town.- You know I'm down.- Good. Now get to class. Then a few years later, when Callie was 10, I think... yes, that's right. Her mother died suddenly. Her father obviously wasn't in the picture, and there were no other family members to call on. So, they were put into the system. Unfortunately, they haven't been able to land anywhere, for more than six months at a time. Could I trouble you for some more coffee, please? Yeah, of course. Now, we keep trying to put them somewhere permanent, but then something happens, and we have to move them onto somewhere new. Something happens? What exactly does that mean?- Something like last night?- I feel terrible about that. That is my fault. I had an emergency on another case. Otherwise, I would've been there for Callie and connected her with Jude, and none of that would've happened. Thank you. Look, they're really great kids, they've just had bad luck. That's just so heartbreaking. So you are looking for something permanent for them? Always. We already have three teenagers. What do you think? So, the seventh grade classes are mostly on the south corridor. With all the high school kids?- Yeah.- Does that mean I get to see Callie? Well, not all the time, but she'll be around. And if you need anything at all, I'm always here, ok?- Hey.- Morning.- Everything all right?- Um. Hey Jude, why don't you wait out in the hall, and I'll take you to class in a sec. Hey. What's up? So, I was on my way to class and I found this lying by a trash can. [ Lena ] Pills. Well, you know what this means. [ Man ] Locker search. Everyone line up.\u266a take the time with me babe\u266a- What's this?- It's ibuprofen. Over the counter. For cramps. Uh, you're good. How many kids are you selling to anyway? I don't know, five or six? You better hope none of them are keeping their stash in their lockers.- Got the report filed.- Good boy.- You driving?- I'm driving. Ok.- So, that was quite a night?- Yes, it was. Anybody run away this morning? That's funny. No. Nope. Gave Brandon quite a talking to though. But I've decided not to ground him, so he's thrilled. What? You're kidding, right? No. The kid basically went awol last night, damn near got himself killed. Yeah, exactly. So, Lena thought that he's very well aware of the consequences and no benefit to punishing him.- Oh, Lena thought.- Ok, take it easy. Easy. First time he's ever done anything like this before. Right, which is all the more reason to set boundaries. We set plenty of boundaries for him. Well, apparently not enough. God. Look, I'm sure hippie- dippie Lena with her PhD in child... whatever the hell it is, has some opinions about why punishing him would damage his blossoming sense of self, but the thing is, Stef, I'm his dad. Yes, Mike. I'm well aware of that. Right, and you should've talked to me about it first. Come on, it'll be fun. I told you nobody'd go. I thought we had a good time. Well, I don't know what to tell you. Tell me that you'll go out with me again. Yeah, I don't think so. Why do you have to be such a bitch? Come on. Hey, she said no, man.- Yeah, I heard her.- So, why are you still in her face? Take a walk. Why don't you just relax, ok? Why don't you get out of here?- Watch yourself, crackhead.- What'd you call me?- Jesus, knock it off...- Hey! What is going on here? Huh?\u266a I feeling plain ordinary and I don't have to fight...\u266a [ Teacher ] Need the bathroom, Jude? Go ahead. Are you ok?- Mm- hm.- Finding everything? Yeah. Ok, good. I just wanted to make sure. Did you see Bill? Yep. Did he say anything? Like what? I don't know. Like anything? He said,\" hi.\"- Why?- Just wondering. Now get back in there. Learn something. This is not like you to get into a fight. I know, I'm sorry. The guy was being rude to Lexi. Ok. So, you can't have a conversation about that?- Why did this have to get physical?- I don't know. Did you take your pill today? Yeah.- Are you sure?- Yeah. A hundred percent. Ok, maybe it's time we called Dr. Hitchin's and set another appointment. I don't need to see... can't I have a bad day once in awhile without being some psych case? All right. Don't let this happen again. If you feel yourself getting worked up, just take a deep breath and walk away. Ok? Go to class. Hey, you got in a fight? Lexi told me. [ Sighs ] I didn't take my meds, so I was kind of jumpy. Why aren't you taking your pills? I'm skipping a few days to save your ass so mom wouldn't notice the pills are missing. Don't worry, they didn't find anything in the lockers,- so you're fine.- Hey, calm down.- You're gonna get us both busted.- Us or you? You're welcome, by the way.- Hey.- Hey. I was just avoiding the whole\" who do I sit with at lunch\" thing. Gotcha.- I'll let you practice.- No, no. You can stay.- Are you sure?- Yeah. So, you're really not getting grounded or anything? Are your moms usually that cool or is it just'cause you never do anything wrong? No, I mean, I do stuff. It's not like I've never got in trouble before.- Really?- Yeah.- Like?- Like, I...- I got caught stealing.- Yeah?- Yes.- What? A car. Yeah. A matchbox when I was five. [ Laughs ] Yeah. No, you're bad news.- Yeah.- Yeah. Hm. What? Nothing. No, I just... I wonder how... you even know who you are if you just do what everybody else thinks you should do?- [ Strums a chord ]- Nice, do you play? Uh, a little. I used to. My mom taught me some before she... Before she? Lena, honey?- Hi.- Hey. Listen, I'm sorry. Mike is right behind me.- Why is Mike coming over?- Because he thinks we should have a discussion, a conversation perhaps, in regards to Brandon.- Hey.- Hey. Mike and I, we were talking at work and... he feels that perhaps, we've gone a little too easy on Brandon, and that he may indeed need some sort of punishment. Ok, I hear that. But unfortunately, we already spoke to Brandon. We can speak to him again. Mike, I think that Brandon really understands the consequences of his actions and there's no value... With all due respect, what you think isn't really my concern... Hey, wait a minute, Mike. Lena is his parent, too. Respectfully, that may be true. But I am his father and you're his mother. Excuse me?- You know what I mean.- I know what you mean. What do you think? Lena, you know that I think you are his mother, too. No, that's fine. That's fine. I'm not his mother, I'm not his father.- Mike is right.- No, he is not. What do you think about Brandon's punishment? I think that Mike has a point. [ Footsteps ]- Hey bud.- What's up? What are we talking about? We're having a discussion right now. The three of us, if you don't mind. Actually, we're talking about your punishment. But I thought I wasn't punished. You are. You're grounded, one week. School and home, that's it.- What? No, but I made plans.- Oh, you made plans.- Yeah.- Oh, that's funny,' cause you didn't have any trouble blowing off your plans to be at the music competition, did you? Ok, and since when do you even care?- Excuse me?- [ Stef ] Brandon? Where have you been? No, no, seriously, dad. When do you even care? You're never around. When have you ever cared? You call me once, like every two days, five minute phone calls. Why should I even listen to you? Great. This is awesome. Let me know who I'm supposed to be taking orders from. That went well. Honey, listen, that's... not supposed to be the way... [* Rock music playing ] [ Knocking ] [ Music blaring from headphones ]- I'm listening to that.- You can't skip your pills. Well, what do you want me to do? Thanks to someone I seem to be missing a whole bunch.- You got a better idea?- You still have a few left, right? How many? Like a week or so?- Like, three.- Ok, how about this... you keep taking them and you take them till you run out, and we can tell moms you dropped the rest down the sink. Yeah, ok. Fine. In case I haven't said it... You haven't. Well, I'm sorry. For all of this. It's cool. [ Music blaring in headphones ] Sixteen. And this one? No, you know that. What do you have to do? You have to divide it by the\" y.\" It's four. The answer's four. You should've known that. You should've known that. I did know that.- No, you didn't.- Yeah, I did.- Uh- uh.- Yeah!- [ Laughing ]- So cheeky!- Stop it!- No, you stop it. How long are we going to be here? I don't know, kid.- Finish your homework.- Ok. I am sorry I ambushed you, Lena. All right? This was something that Mike felt very strongly about, obviously. When you feel like talking to me, Lena. Let me know. I thought we were on the same page. I thought we agreed. I've never felt like such a stepmother in my entire life.- Lena...- And just so we're clear, I am done disciplining Brandon if this is the way it's going to be. I'm just going to be good- time stepmom from now on. You want some candy, Brandon? Sure, help yourself! Want some cigarettes? Smoke it up! Lung cancer be damned! Want some booze? No? How about some heroin? Oh, wow. Point taken. Please put down the knife. You're scaring me. Lena, come on, love. What was I supposed to do? Mike is Brandon's father. This was a big decision and we didn't include him in it. Can you imagine how you would feel if something like this- happened with mariana or Jesus?- It's not the same thing.- Mike is not the twins father.- Obviously. You know that's not what I meant. You would not like it...- If parental decisions were being made without me...- Without you. Yes, I get that, but in what world is it ok for you to take Mike's side in front of me? I didn't take his side, Lena. I simply said... You humiliated me in front of him. I'm sorry, that is not what I meant to do. But you asked, what was I supposed to say? You lie, Stef. You lie. Ok, I'm sorry. It's not easy for me either, you know. It's no fun playing peacekeeper between you and Mike when you're acting like Israel and Palestine. It kind of stinks. Look, Brandon has three parents, period. No getting around it. Mike had no right to say otherwise. I know that's not what he thinks, I really do. And we're all just trying to do our best to figure this out. I'm going to go talk to Brandon. All right?- We're ok for now?- We're good. Great. [ Playing keyboard ]- B?- Yeah? I get that you're frustrated, it seems to be a common theme around the house these days. But, that's no reason to talk to your father that way. He's a good man, he's a good dad, and he does care very, very much, he always has. I know, I know. I'm sorry.- You're sorry?- I'm sorry. I didn't mean any of it.- It's just...- I know. You know what you need to do. By the way, Lena wants you to know, that if you ever need any heroin, she's happy to help. Huh? Never mind, that was funnier in my head. I'm sorry. Oh, you playing again? I remember the day you bought that. Saved up all your money, all on your own, I was so proud of you. Call your dad. Yeah. [ Door closes ] Hi. Dinner is not quite ready yet. Do you want something to drink or...? Is everything ok? Yeah, I was just wondering if you had any chores for me. Chores? Yeah, well, foster families are gonna send us away right away, they usually give us chores and stuff. You know what? You could really help me... I forgot the salad forks. So, are you and Stef married? Well, not exactly. Not legally, no. We're married in our hearts, I guess. That's basically the same thing, right? Basically, yeah. Yeah. [ Stef ] Everyone, grab a seat. So, we have something to talk about, obviously. Uh, Stef and I had our meeting with bill, and we've come to a decision. We are not in a position to offer Jude and Callie a home forever. [ Stef ] But we would like you guys to be as comfortable and safe as possible, until bill does find you a permanent home.- However long that may take.- It could be a week, it could be a year.- We just don't know.- Yeah. We want this to be your very last way station ever, ever, ever. Ok? So, that means, we need to get you guys out of the living room. I think you'll be ok to camp down there one more night, but tomorrow we're having some beds delivered, so after school let's help get them settled in, ok? [ Stef ] Yes, Brandon and Jesus, could use a little muscle, all right? Jude, my sweet, new, young friend. You'll be moving in with Jesus. And Callie, you'll be moving into Mariana's room, all right? Hey Mariana! Lexi is here! Hey. Oh, hey. I just wanted to say thanks. I know you were just trying to stick up for me. I... I didn't mean to yell at you. You didn't have to go all Iron Man on his ass, but, you know, thank you. What are you doing? Come on, I need your help. I have to get rid of a bunch of stuff so Callie can move into my room. It's a freaking nightmare. Seriously, I don't understand why they just can't move into the dining room? It's not like we ever use it, right? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe we can put them in the closet or under the stairs, like in Harry Potter? I mean, come on guys. Let's think about how they must feel. They're not here forever. Let's try to make them feel a little more welcome. Easy for you to say. You're not giving up anything. Lexi, come here. Wait, what do you mean? I thought you weren't getting grounded? What about Callie? If you're getting punished, is she going back to juvie? No. No, she's actually going to be living with us for a while now. Wait... you're not jealous, are you? Of Callie? No. Ok.'Cause you have no reason to be. Yeah, obviously. You know, that's cool of your moms. Letting her stay. She was just trying to help save her brother, right? Yeah. Brandon called you, right?- Yeah, said he was sorry.- Good. He was kind of right, though. No, he was not. He was not right to talk to you... Not about the me not caring part. I mean, look, when was the last time that you and Lena really talked to me about Brandon? [ Sighs ] Ok, listen, Mike. You're right. We have... No, no, no. I'm not blaming you. I'm not saying it's your fault. That's not what I mean. You guys are so good and involved and there all the time. I just feel like it was so easy to turn the reins over. I don't want to do that any more, Stef. I don't want to hand my kid over. I don't want to be some half- assed version of a dad. You're not a half- assed version of a dad. I know, but you know what I mean. [ Indistinct radio chatter ] You guys know she just got out of juvie, right? Kelsey, I told you not to tell anyone. I know, but I think that they should know. Watch out, she'll totally shiv you or something.- Shank.- Huh? A shiv is a thing, a shank's what you do with it.- Oh.- My mom's a cop. Damn girl, it's like Grand Theft Auto around your place. Seriously. Hey Callie! Over here. So, how are you? I mean, I know it's been a crazy couple of days for you. Uh, no, I'm fine. Thanks. So, where are you from? Just around. Uh- huh. Great. Is that your brother you were talking to this morning? Yeah, that's Jude. Wow, he's totally adorable. Ah, he's all right.- I like your bracelets.- Thank you. I should get some like that. So cool. Yeah, I really like your scarf. So, how long are you guys gonna be here for? A couple weeks, a month... six months? I have no idea. It's not really up to me. Right...'cause we should get you in some clubs. You know, so you can meet more people. It's got to be hella boring hanging out with Brandon all the time. You'd know a lot about that. Right? We're together pretty much all the time. Stef and Lena are so supportive of our relationship. Stef even buys his condoms. Hello! How great is that?- Oh, it's really great.- [ Giggling ] So... I just... Yes. So, I wasn't really right in the head yesterday. Meaning... Meaning, um, I probably shouldn't have... It's cool. But you probably shouldn't go kissing me every time you have a bad day. Oh yeah? Who said you're the only girl I kissed yesterday? Oh, really? Really. [ Girl sniffing ] You got a little... What is it and who gave it to you? You can tell me or we can call the police and you can tell them. It's up to you. What's it gonna be, Kelsey? Where'd you get the drugs? Where is she? This one kid, Connor, was pretty nice, though. They're reading this book, a Wrinkle in... something.- Time?- Huh? Anyways, I don't get it. It's kind of confusing. What? Why are both my moms home? What's going on? Mariana, could you take Jude upstairs, please? We need to talk to Callie. Yeah, sweets, it's ok. She'll be right up. Callie? We've been told that you... stole Jesus's pills? And have been selling them at school? Is this true? Is this true?- No.- You sure about that? Uh- huh. Then why would this student say that you did? I guess I'm just an easy target. Right. Will you give us a minute, please? So, what do we do? I don't know, maybe we should call Mike.- Oh, yes, feisty.- Uh- huh.- I'm trying, love.- I know.- Mike didn't mean what he said about...- I know, I know. Mike called me, we talked. Really, what'd he say? That's between me and Mike. So, did you ask Talya to have lunch with Callie? Wait, what? They had lunch?- Talya has lost her mind.- She's insecure, bro. I mean, suddenly got this hot 16 year old girl...- You think Callie's hot?- You don't? I better figure something out, or Talya's going to have a complete meltdown on me. Better do something big. Make her feel special. But I'm grounded, remember? Improvise. Hey, you didn't make any plans tonight, right? No, good, don't. I... I'm gonna sneak out, and come see you. No, I don't care if I get in trouble. It's worth it. Ok. Bye. Where's Jude? He's reading magazines in my room. He's ok. [ Sighs ] Good. I don't know what I'm gonna tell him. So, what happened? They think that I stole your brother's pills.- What did you tell them?- Well, I didn't tell them that it was you, if that's what you're asking me. Why not? As if they'd believe me. Hey. Are you really going to let Callie take the fall for you? They're gonna send her away. They're gonna be so mad at me. The other night, when Ana just took all that money from me... like I was an ATM or something, not even a person, much less her daughter. I thought,\" well, hey... at least, I have two moms at home who love me.\"- They're gonna hate me.- They're not gonna hate you.- I promise.- They're totally going to cancel my quinceanera. Will you come with me to tell them? [ Strumming chords ] Surprised you want to consort with a known drug trafficker. [ Laughs ] Well, did you do it? What do you think? I think you're playing the G chord wrong. Try the six string on the third fret. There you go. Thank you... for the guitar. You're welcome. I can't remember anything. I think that was a C there.- I was right?- Here. And then, I think if you move these two down, you'll make another chord there. [ Strumming ] Nice. Hi. It was me, I did it. Did what? The pills. Ok. You care to explain. I was feeling like a freak. Just tired being the kid with add. Everyone always asking me,\" did you take your pill?\"\" Did you take your pill?\" You know, so I stopped. I started hiding them in my pocket. Kelsey saw them at school and she told me she heard they make you really smart, and really focused. She needed some for a paper she had to write. So, I gave her one. And some more. And things just got out of hand.- [ Strumming ]- G, C... Hey Brandon, will you excuse us for a sec? Uh, yeah. Um, well... it would appear that we were given some false information. And I promise I'm going to find out how that happened exactly. Yeah, we're very sorry that we didn't believe you. We feel that trust is something that has to be earned. Right? We would really like to start earning yours.- Yeah.- Ok. All right. Let's go. I'm glad we're staying. I like it here. Yeah? Don't like it too much. [ Beep ] [ Laughs ] [ Strumming ] [ Playing keyboard ] God, I can't remember anything. [ Laughs ] Just keep trying. I mean, it'll come back.

{"title": "Futurama Meanwhile", "content": "Subs created by: David Coleman. Remember this place, Leela? Yep. The moon. It's been here for quite a while. Yeah, but it's also where we came on our very first delivery together! Oh, right. Man, we sure used to try harder back then. Get your likeness in the form of a balloon sculpture! A cherished family keepsake for hours to come! One Leela, please. And, uh, use your finest balloons. Wow, you're good. Five years of art school.- Want a corndog?- Sure. Then your mom should have bought you one.- Ooh, fancy!- Hold tight! The Mecha- Hexadecapus is about to flail erratically into action! Whoa... Oh, yeah... Oh... You know, I'm feeling a little... Leela! Poor Leela! I never even told her I loved her! What?! You told her, like, a 140 times! Yeah, but she paid very little attention to me. Oh, Bender! I always thought me and her would grow old together! You gotta live in the moment, baby! And in this moment, Leela's dead. Sir, we have some good news and some bad news. The good news is, we found your stuffed animal.- What's the bad news?- Your wife is dead.- She wasn't my wife!- Oh! Then there is no bad news. Leela! You're alive! She gave her life to save mine. Bender, can I come in and talk? I'm kinda busy. Seeing Leela fly off the Hexadecapus and crash through the moon dome and survive inside a stuffed animal by breathing a balloon was a dose of reality. Come in... All this time, I've been wondering if I can spend my life with her. But what I realize now is, I can't spend my life without her. So, tomorrow, I'm asking her to marry me. Uh- huh. Good talk. We're done here. My little meatbag's growing up. Computer, Jamaican Joy Juice, hot! G. N., E.! Behold the Time Button! A pocket- sized device that sends the entire universe ten seconds into the past! I will now demonstrate. Joy Juice, hot. Pretty cool, eh? I'm over here where I was ten seconds ago. Something's cool? Show it to us! Whuh? Oh, right. You were outside the button ball, so you don't remember a thing I said. Let's try again, but this time, everyone cram into my time shelter. Ooh, nice! It's coated with antichroniton- resistant grout to shield you from the effects of the button. Come on. Get in. Hurry up. Friends, I found a ten dollars! Ten dollars, you say? Let me see. It fell off a man. The man got into a taxi, but the money did not. Friends, I found a ten dollars! You found some money? Show me. Say, check out the money I found. It fell off a chump! Hey, Professor, couldn't you go back in time as far as you want by pressing the button over and over? Certainly not! Each time the button sends you back ten seconds, it takes ten seconds to recharge. There, it's recharged.- Again, again!- Uh, question? What if you had a special moment that you wished could go on forever? Could the Time Button make it last as long as you wanted? Hell, no! This button is for scientific use only. Uh, yes, I'd like an engagement diamond, please? You come to the right joint, ace. I'll take... this one. Classy choice, chief. She'll crap her pants. That'll be five bills. Hey, give me back my stones! Hello, stranger. This is my first time here.- Do you sell diamonds?- You come to the right joint, ace. I guess what I'm saying is, the next time you almost die, I want it to be as my wife. The clam, Elzar. Clam, bam, thank you, ma'am! Fry...? Wow... Leela, my love... will you...? I'll have what she's having. Oh, God! I ruined everything! I blew my one chance to... Hey, wait a second! Clam, bam, thank you, ma'am! Fry...? Wait! Allow me. Leela, my love, will you marry me? Oh, my gosh! This is all so sudden...- after 13 years.- Don't answer yet! I want this to be a special moment, so I rented the roof garden on top of the tallest building in New New York.- The Vampire State Building?- Uh huh. If your answer's yes, be there tonight at 6: 30, half hour before sunset. And if my answer's no? Then just don't show up. I'll get the message. Big night, eh, Mr. Fry? The biggest, Jan\u00f6s. Check this out. What is that? Some kind of time button? Exactly. If she says yes, I'll use it to make the sunset last as long as we want. Strange things happen when the shadows lengthen. Six o'clock. She'll be here in half an hour. 6: 30? Maybe she's stuck in slow traffic. I know she'll come. I know it. I really thought she was gonna come. I traveled a thousand years forward in time, but without Leela, I have no future. This is the end. Good- bye, my love. Leela?! Hey! It's only 6: 25! So why does my watch say 7: 03?! Of course! My watch is fast because it kept running every time I hit the button! So Leela's actually on time! Hi, Leela! Fry! It's okay, I'm gonna die happy! No, wait! I'll go back ten seconds till when I was on the roof! Rats. Guess I was falling for more than ten seconds. Hi, Leela! Fry! Everything's cool! Wait a second. There's no possible way out of this situation! Help, help...! Fry! I'm stuck in a loop! This isn't the moment I wanted to last forever! Careful. This is the most valuable thing we've ever delivered. Oop!- Careful. This is the most...- Quickly! Into the time shelter! Someone stole the Time Button, and they're pressing it every ten seconds! The universe is caught in a time loop! Then let's go out and stop them! Are you mad?! Because that would make two of us. Ugh! You're right. We'd never get anywhere. We'd just keep jumping back to where we started. Also, we'd die horribly! You see, we're shielded in here. So if we leave the time shelter and the button gets pressed less than ten seconds later, the antichronitons wouldn't know where to send us back to! We'd be shredded across the time- space continuum like human coleslaw! Yum! Observe. Aw... Listen, I know who stole the button. I wasn't gonna tell, because I don't like being helpful. But I do like ratting people out, so... it was Fry! He took it to the Vampire State Building. We've got to get to him. But how? We can't leave the time shelter. Hooray! I'm trapped in a tiny fun room with friends! Man, falling from a great height an infinite number of times can be stressful. At least I have Leela's comforting scream to look forward to. Fry!- Fry!- Whuh? Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, stop! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry hurry, hurry, hurry...- Hurry, hurry, hurry...- Oh! Fry! We're here to rescue you! Professor? Oops. Fry! Professor? He's... he's dead. It does look that way. My poor sweet puddle! The button! I can still save him! No, don't! You'll shred me into a zillion... It worked! But you killed the Professor! Yeah, but it worked! I died. I'm dead! I'm gonna die! Come on, come on. Fry, what's happening? Did you fall off the building? Actually, that's kind of a funny story... He sure has a lot of blood for a skinny guy. And I didn't want to go on living without you, so I jumped, and, well... Oh... That's so sweet, Fry. You know those dreams where you're falling, and right before you hit the ground you wake up? Those are great. If only there were a way to make Fry land softly, this would all be over. Ooh, I know! My airbag! Leela! I'm coming to save the day! Hang on, Fry! You're just one death away from being saved! And then we can be marry me? Okay, I'm gonna run out there. Then, you guys form a human bus and crash into me at 40 miles an hour. Ready? Go! We did it! Wh- What happened? Did I break the button? I think you broke the universe. Everything but us is frozen. What are we gonna do? First, I'm gonna get back these earrings I loaned Amy three years ago. After that, I don't know. This is surreal. Whatever we want is ours for the taking. Hello? Anyone? I guess it's just us for all eternity. Listen, Leela, I'm not sure what kind of life we can make together in this frozen time- sicle, but if it's not too weird... will you still marry me? I would marry you even if you weren't the last man on Earth.- What was that?- I don't know... but I'm scared. Well, maybe we just need some rest. We can get married in the morning. Except there won't be morning. We can worry about that in the morning. Do I, Philip J. Fry, take you, Turanga Leela, to be my lawful wedded wife? You do. Do I, Turanga Leela, take you, Philip J. Fry, to be my lawful wedded husband? Uh... yes? Absolutely. There it is again! Leave my wife alone, you glimmer! It's okay, Fry. If it keeps bugging us, we'll either kill it or adopt it. Meanwhile, what do you say we get started on a very, very, very long honeymoon? I think it's about time we drank the champagne Jan\u00f6s poured all those years ago. May I read the toast I was going to make? Go for it. I'm in no rush, after walking up 240 flights of steps. And across those oceans.\" To us.\" If I could make one moment last forever, this is the one I would choose.\" I'm glad you did. It was a good life. Kind of lonely, though? Maybe? I was never lonely. Not even for a minute. I guess we'll never figure out what that glimmer is. Nope. Pretty, though. Hey, hey, wait... it's doing something! I'll protect you. Hi... yow! Professor?!- You're alive?!- Yes, it's me. Boy, did somebody hit you two with an old- and- ugly- stick. I thought I killed you with the Time Button. I thought so, too, at first. But it seems I was simply rotated into an orthogonal time that runs at right angles to this one. I've been tunneling for decades, searching every instant from yesterday to tomorrow. We've been right now the whole time. I wasn't looking for you, I was looking for the Time Button. Oh! I landed on it and time froze. I tried to fix it once, but then I got mad and hit it some more. I guess it's good we didn't have children. Oh, give me that, you senile old idiot! Oh, let me see... that goes there... lefty loosey, righty tighty, and... fixed! What?! I could've fixed it that easily? You? Okay. I've modded the device to release a single huge antichroniton blast. It should rip us out of stasis, back to the instant before I conceived of the Time Button. You mean we'll all get to live our lives over again? Oh, my, yes. Even that nasty robot, what's- his- name. Of course, we won't remember anything that's happened. What do you say? Want to go around again? I do.

{"title": "Melissa & Joey What Happens in Jersey...: Part 1", "content": "It's a no- go, Theresa! Yeah, look, I love Nona as well. She's my Grandmother too! Look, if there was a way I could do it, I'd do it! Yeah, you too! Jeez, why are you so mad at your sister? I'm not mad at her. That's New Jersey for\" I love you\". Wow, so how do you tell if someone angry? The police show up. I am upset though. My Grandmother Sofia is failing. Next week is her birthday and it's probably going to be her last. And all she wants is to see me and Tiffany together.- One final time.- Why does she want to see your ex- wife? I kinda never told her that we got divorced.- So you lied to her.- Hey, I was protecting her! Why can't you people see that?! Joe, we're simple Ohio people. No yelling is required. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Once I let the Jersey out, it's very hard to walk it back.- Joe, have some Guava juice.- Thank you, man, thank you. So when you go back there to see her, what're you going to say?\" Happy 99th birthday, Nona. I'm divorced\". I might as well just plunge a knife into her congested old heart. Hey, why don't you just ask Tiffany to go with you you can pretend you're married for a couple hours? That is the stupidest idea I ever heard and I already tried that. Want to know what's funny though? I don't really want to ask any more questions. My Nona's eyesight's so bad she probably wouldn't know the difference between Tiffany and a wall. I mean, you know, if the wall was, like, stacked. And wore a leopard- print skirt and a lot of make- up. [ Chuckles ] Honestly, any blonde like that would probably do. Hello, people of my kitchen! I was shoe shopping. Check out the latest in Stiletto heels. Now be honest, everyone. Do these make me look too trashy? I'd say just trashy enough. [ Theme music playing ] Come on, it's two days out of your life! Everyone else'll know the truth. All you'll have to fool is my Grandmother. The whole idea is ridiculous! Nobody would believe me as Tiffany. I'm way too classy! It's a dying woman's last request! Don't guilt trip me. And what are you getting so mad about anyway? What? This is a conversational tone in New Jersey. Come on, Aunt Mel, all four of us can go. It'll be like cultural anthropology... You know, observe the Longos in their natural habitat.- Don't you have prom?- I decided not to go. Zander and I are in a pre- college separation. It's a pause. And no, I don't want to talk about it. A trip to Jersey? I'm in.- Boy, do I need to get out of this house.- What's wrong with this house? Home schooling is not the amusement- park ride it's cracked up to be. You know how many tiles are on that wall? 4, 076. Go ahead, count'em. You know what, guys? I appreciate the fact that you'd be willing to go. It shows really really great character. But unfortunately without Tiffany the whole trip is a lost cause. Let me say it to you in Jersey. I ain't going! All right, look, I've met your ex- wife. I just don't see myself being able to pull that off. That whole little girl act? It's not me. All right, fine. Guess I was asking too much. I'll just make the trip myself and I'll tell her I'm divorced and she'll just have to live with it. Or I guess... die with it. All right, look, I know you think I'm being selfish, but you're wrong. Who wants to see the other shoes I bought? [ Squeals ] [ Loudly ] Yes yes, Nona! It's Joey. Yeah, absolutely. I'm gonna be there Saturday. I wouldn't miss it. N... no no. Tiffany's not gonna be able to make it. No no... no no, hey hey, don't... Don't... don't cry, Nona. No no, it's really not good for your heart. It's just... no! No, my wife loves you. [ Laughs ] More than she loves me, I can say that honestly.- It's just that... no, hey!- What is that boy telling you? Of course I'm coming, Nona! No, JoeJoeBee is just being a Silly Willy. But I love him oodles and oodles and oodles. I'll see you Saturday. Mwah mwah mwah! How was that? Pretty much dead on.- Are you really gonna do this for me?- [ Sighs ] Yeah, I can't believe it either. She better really be dying or I'm going to be pissed. _. Welcome to Moller Street, everybody! This is the Via Veneto of Secaucus! Literally the highest concentration of Longos on the eastern seaboard. So the whole Longo mob lives here, huh? Hey, yo yo yo, we don't use the\" M\" word in this neighborhood, all right? What, Mafia? What's up, Mr. Spizeri? How you doing? All right, yeah! So how's my beautiful wife doing in there, huh? Ugh! Just adjusting my Golden Globes. Are they symmetrical? May I? Yeah, go for it. I can't feel a thing. This is all push- up and padding. It's identical twins, right, guys? Jo- eeeey! Mom, hey! Are you even more handsome than you were the last time? [ Laughs ] I think so.- That's my boy. That's my boy.- Both: Mwah mwah! And here's the family. Is this the Mel Burke? This is Mel Burke. This is Tiffany. Got it. And these are the kids with the weird names? Yeah, this is Lennox, that there is Ryder, this is my mother.- Hi.- How's it going?- Hey, how's Nona doing?- Fantastic! Considering she's at death's door... Hold on. That's how you're walking? It's worked my whole life. No. Anybody can see it's not Tiffany. Much too lady- like. You gotta work it like a skanky debutante. Tramp, slut, tramp, slut, tramp, slut, tramp, slut, tramp, slut slut, tramp tramp, slut slut... Mom, mom. We get it. We get it. The whole neighborhood gets it. Come on, guys. [ Door closes ] Shh shh shh!- Okay okay.- Yo, big sis! Shh, Joey! Nona's sleeping. Thank God the doctors still let us give her wine.- Uncle Joe!- Hey. How was the drive? Did you take the parkway? No, I- 95. 65 miles per the whole way, no tolls. That is genius. We'll let the historians judge, know what I mean? Yeah, guys, this is my nephew Marco. Marco, meet Ryder and that there is Lennox. Lennox? That's not a Moller- street name. It's Scottish. It means\" with many Elm trees\". I don't know any Elm trees, but I bet I'd like'em. So do we just stand here until she wakes up or...- Doesn't wake up?- Let her sleep. We'll get you folks fed, especially the skinny boy.- Come on.- All right, the skinny boy! I already have a street name. [ Clatters ] Hey, Nona! Hey, it's me... Joey! Joey! Oh, and is that Tiffany? Who else would it be? Oh oh. [ Joe chuckles ] What are you... [ chuckles ] It's...- It's really you!- [ Laughs ] Oh, my Tiffany! And you, Joey!- Ma familia!- Hey! We're in. [ Music ] 99 years old tomorrow, wow! What are you going to get her? Soft food. So, Lennox, girl of the Elms...- Listen...- I have a boyfriend. Thank you. And I'm sure he's a great guy. I was just gonna offer to show you around the neighborhood. There might be a body floating down the river. I'm kidding. They fished it out last week. Well, I am very curious about New Jersey... Its ways and customs, your cultural mores. Hey, there's a brand- new dollar store that just opened up. You can buy a pack of\" AA\" batteries for a buck. Well, what are we waiting for? Hey, Marco! Stop flirting and get Nona a fresh pillowcase. I'm on it, ma. So what do you mean you have a boyfriend? Aren't you and Zander on a whole pre- college trial- separation\" pause\" thing? Yes. However, I am utterly uninterested in someone like Marco, so I lied and said I was taken. All girls say that to guys they don't like. They do? That explains so much. Joey... That was the first time your Grandmother has been on her feet in a week. And you know why? You. She saw\" Tiffany\"... And it gave her the will to live. Ha! And you didn't think I could pull this off. No, that was you. I begged you to do it.- Let it go.- I will say this... She is a big improvement over the original blow- up doll. Mel Burke, you are obviously a very giving and selfless person. See, she gets me. Hey, Gloria, do you have any more of that capa... Capa meat stuff? Capicola. Capicola. Capicola. Capicola. Say it.- Capicola?- He's Italian! And so handsome. You remind me of this one over here. Now you just sit down and I will do everything.- You've had a hard day.- But I was just sitting in a car. Wasting away in a car if you ask me. Now you just sit down and eat while I tell you what a good- looking and wonderful boy you are. Wow, we are witnessing the origin story of Joe's ego. [ Ryder chuckles ] Yeah.- Hey.- Joey, where are you going? In 20 minutes we wake her to watch\" jeopardy\". I mean, she doesn't know any of the answers, but she likes the song. We're just going to go to the hotel.- Tiffany!- Ah! Oh, it's got me! I mean, uh, yes, Nona? Where are you going? We'll be back in a couple hours, okay? Don't leave me. I don't know how much time I have left. I'm so weak. Ow ow ow ow ow! Please, stay in this house tonight. If we do, will you let go? You can sleep in Joey's old room. Us? Together? Like a married couple does. Uh, yes yes. Of course we will, Nona. Anything you say. But, JoeJoeBee, we have a hotel reservation. Yes, TiffyPop, but Nona dying for us to sleep here. Okeydokey. We'll stay here. [ Chuckles ] It's a small bed. So you're gonna have to get real cozy. [ Laughs ] I just made a joke.- [ Slaps ]- Ow! Your sweet old Grandmother just groped me on the ass. If you're gonna shake it like that, you can't blame her. Hey, so as soon as the house quiets down, I'll move downstairs and bunk in the spare room, okay? Well, I am not sleeping under a poster of whoever that chick is on the ceiling. Are you kidding me? Who grew up in America and didn't know who Vendela was? Who? Vendela Kirsebom, the swimsuit model. Come on, she was huge. Actually in this neighborhood she was even bigger than Ashley Montana. Again, who? That one over there, with the snake covering up all the good stuff. You know what? You and the girls can stay here and relive the glory days and I'll go find a room where the decor is a little less\" ma, would you knock first?!\" How you ladies been? [ Door opens ] Ah ah! Nona! Uh, look at you, smacking people awake. I know the truth! You are not fooling anybody. I know what's really going on. Um, well, you see, I... I did it all for Joe. It comes from a good place. Don't die, okay? There is trouble in this marriage. Oh, marriage! No no, there's no trouble. No, this is what we do to keep things fresh. You know, when Joe wants me, he has to come find me. Come and get me, JoeJoeBee! A wife should share her husband's bed.- Generally yes...- Hey, what's up?- Nona!- You found me, lover! I was just explaining to dear Nona how I like to hide, which explains why I wasn't sleeping in your bed. Oh, yes yes. Yes, that's something that we like to do. It keeps it exciting.- [ Laughs ] Where are you, huh?- Boo.- Where are you?- Boo. There she is. She's right there, you see... There is great unhappiness between you two. That's why there are no children in this marriage.- Ooh.- Oh oh oh, here here here. Come on, let's set you down. Come on. Mel, up please, thank you. Thank you, Mel. There you go, Nona. Who's Mel? Mel... that's... it's a... that's a nickname that I call her. Yeah yeah, it stands for... My eternal love. My husband used to call me Strega. Aren't pet names sweet? It means\" witch\"! Aw. I want to speak to your wife for a moment. Sure, yeah. Okay, here.- All right.- Here, honey. Good. Tiffany? Me? Oh yeah, shoot. Ahem. How many times a week do you have marital relations?- Uh...- How many times? Uh, twice! Twice a week. That's not enough! A man needs comfort from a woman. Especially if he's a big man in the business world like Joseph. Up in his high building. You capture him so well. I know he can be a little headstrong. That's what he's been like since his father walked out. And Joey was only 10 and he had to be the man of the house. All right, now switch, switch. I want to talk to my favorite grandson. Sorry about that. They all love me here. I can do no wrong. Ow, whoa! What's the matter with you, huh? This woman is an Angel. I have always told you that.- Stop fighting with her.- I'm not fighting with her. Don't lie to a dying lady! Hey, not the cane, okay? Not the cane. All right, now hold hands. Hold hands. Ooh, look at you two. You're made for each other. Look, you didn't have to buy me flowers.- Here.- But you look good with them. They bring out your pretty eyes. All right, look, Marco, while I appreciate the tour of the meat district.- And seeing all the pigs' heads dangling.- That's something, isn't it? I just, I need you to understand that this is going to stay platonic. I don't know that word, but I get it through context. Listen, while we're here I gotta get cigarettes for my dad. Turns out they're not so bad for you. I'm not serious. Nice flowers. What are those, tulips? I think so. I know where she oughta put her two lips.- Right here.- All right, guys, give it a rest.- It's not working.- Oh, it could work.- And I could show you how.- Just leave me alone. That sounded pretty clear to me, fellas. She said leave her alone.- Who cares what you think?- Well, that's a good question.- Let my friend knuckles explain it to you.- [ Grunts ] Hey! You forgot your garbage here! I'm really sorry about that.- Are you okay?- Very much so. How's your hand? Lonely. Aunt Lena, Uncle Vince, what's up? Paulie, hey! Sis, you need a hand? Oh, now that all the hard work is done, Mr. Thinks- he's- so- charming shows- up- asking- if- he- can- help. You look great, Theresa. You lost weight, didn't you?- I did. Thanks for noticing.- Yeah! [ Chuckles ] [ Gasps ] What the heck's going on there?- They make a cute couple, don't they?- No, they don't. Hey, Marco, you know she's only here for one more day, right? Yeah, I can count. Oh, good. Because you know even though I'm your Uncle and I love you, my love has limits. [ Chuckles ] Physical limits. It's Nona's big day, Uncle Joe, come on, lighten up. Hey, come on, hey hey.- Okay.- [ Groans ] I could get out of this if I wanted. [ Laughs ] No, you couldn't. Wow, there's just so much testosterone here. Ma, we only got 94 candles. That's all the fire marshal would allow. So, Ryder... [ Chuckles ] Are you happy here? Are we treating you well? Are you kidding? You're treating me like a King. I'm so glad you appreciate all we have done for you. And now... In return I must ask that you do me a service. A service? What... what kind of service? Like take out the recycling or... A problem has come into our neighborhood and you, Ryder, must take care of it. [ Inhales ] I need you to kill a rat. You mean murder? When a thief steals in this neighborhood, he must pay with his life. But I... I've... I've never killed before. This is what's expected of the men in our family. Ma, I need you. Nona can't find her teeth. Did anybody check between the sofa cushions? I'll do it like I do everything else. So ma's putting you to work? She gave me a job. Don't let her down. Aw. All right, everyone needs a full glass! We are going to toast the birthday girl. No! My favorites will drink the good stuff from this special bottle. Now don't spill any. Trust me, I am very skilled at not wasting alcohol. I think that's why I fell in love with her. Everyone raise your glasses! To grandmama Sofia! May she live for another hundred years. God forbid!- Salute, everybody.- [ Toasting ] Wow, what is this? Italian lighter fluid? [ Coughs ] That's some old- country moonshine right there. Drink! Empty the glass otherwise you dishonor me. Wow! This rust- remover kinda grows on you once your mouth stops burning. [ Coughs ]- Are you beginning to feel it?- Give me that! Nona, you didn't! I did! It's fine. They're a married couple. No, they're not! Not accustomed to such a strong drink. You shouldn't have done that without warning them first. I'm 99. I can do whatever I want. Mom, what's going on? Infuso di coniglio. It's the brew of the rabbits. It's a love potion. [ Both laugh ] Nona made another joke, right? Right?! [ Both sniff ] Really? We drank a love potion? With magic powers? Gimme a break. Come on, mom. That's just some crazy old- world Voodoo, right? The rabbit's brew has produced 17 marriages and 80 children. And those are just the ones we know are definitely ours. It channels the life force. The animal spirit. It's... Irresistible. Come on, mom. [ Italian folk music playing ] Holy crap.

{"title": "Grimm Endangered", "content": "Previously on. They call themselves***. Believe me, they're out there.-***-*** Do they all know you're one of these Grimms? I think they can sense it and recognize them. From the beginning, they've conspired by***. Nick took something away from me, so I took something away from him. She's in a coma. They've taken from him.- I love you so much.- Who are you? Doesn't it seem strange that the only thing Juliette doesn't remember is you? Maybe that was Adalind's plan all along. But they*** what matters most. Never lose this. Guard it with your life. The captain is the one who woke Juliette up. He saved your life. What do you want from me? If you and I can overcome our differences, we will make history.- You trust him?- I don't know. Juliette remembered seeing you in the trailer. You think my memory is coming back? What did you take from Constantinople in the 13th century that was so damn important? What the hell did you bury? Damn. What the hell? Are you kidding me? Aah! John? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Bottom line, my dad was very old- school, okay? I mean, very old- school. Your dad still hunts? No. Well, let me put it this way. I don't ask and he knows better than to talk to me about it. But they're not getting any meals on wheels, I'll tell you that much. What about your mom? Well, again, I don't know for sure, but she doesn't let him go anywhere by himself. Especially at night, because he's not also great about finding his way home. Do they still live in the same house you grew up in? They do. Half moon lake, New Hampshire. Same town, same street. Same three- bedroom with a large, kind of den house that backs up against the state forest, you know? For easy access. But the problem is, really, they just... they miss me and they want to come out and spend a couple of weeks. What's wrong with that, huh? Nothing. It's just, they never stay in a hotel. They always stay here and right now it's kind of awkward, because... oh, right. Nick and your parents under the same roof. Yeah, that would be a problem. Yeah, I mean, bottom line, I don't want Nick to kill my parents. Not that they wouldn't give him plenty of reason. I bet Nick would understand, right? Just move out while they're here? He could stay with Hank or even me. Yeah, maybe. It's just that the way things are going right now, I'm not sure Nick could do without my help for that long. Has he said anything about Juliette? No, not much, but it doesn't look to me like they're gonna be getting together anytime soon. Well, hey, you never know. Relationships are unpredictable. Monroe, you up? Hey, Monroe! You home? I need your help! Oh, there you are. Hi, Rosalee. Hello. Oh. Um, this is me intruding, isn't it? I'm going to my room now. Nick, wait, if you need Monroe's... no, no, no. This can wait.- Oh.- See what I mean? I think you're right. It's probably not the best idea to have your parents come out right now. Why don't we try this again tomorrow night? At my place. I'll be there. So... Problem? Sorry, Monroe. But it looks like things are going really well with you two. Yeah. I mean, they're actually going amazing. So one little interruption at just the right moment, not gonna be the end of the world. What do you got?- My aunt gave me this.- What is that? Supposedly it's one of the keys that locked away something very important. Oh, man. This is really old. You ink the sides of it... And it makes the piece of a map. My mom told me there are six more of those and that... hey! Monroe, where are you going? I think I know this, Nick. I think I know this.- The key? Seriously?- No, the map. But the key is very old. I'd say made sometime during the middle ages. You know, a lot of them were first designed in monasteries. It's called a ward- lock, and I'm not talking about a male witch. It's a... they use a set of obstructions called wards. But I'm really more interested in the map right now. Okay. This is an ancient map of Schwaben, which is Swabia, which is in Bavaria. You see the similarities between this map and yours? How do you know all this stuff? Well, my great- great- great- grandfather on my mother's side was a cartographer in Colmar, which is in Alsace Lorraine, which is basically right across from the black forest. Anyway. Anyway, I inherited a ton of his stuff that wasn't burned during the Franco- prussian war when Germany annexed Colmar. My guess, this map of yours was drawn in the Behaim style, which could put it squarely in the Schwarzwald. Sorry, the black forest. See? The way the hills and the waterways are drawn... I mean, this is before they could be all that accurate. So you're telling me from this little piece of map, you think it's somewhere in Germany? Oh, yeah. I'd bet my great- great- great- grandfather on it. What's the map for, anyway? Supposedly crusaders in the 13th century sacked Constantinople, and they found something that they considered too powerful to return to the royal families who helped finance their crusade. And there were seven of them and they were all Grimms. They must have sacked something pretty significant. Any idea what? Nobody seems to know. But a lot of people want to find out and they're willing to kill for it. Okay. So who has the other six keys? I don't know for sure. But there's someone who might. I took you, Nick. I took you to that party at David and Roni's, but what were we doing before we kissed?- Juliette.- Hey.- You don't look very happy.- Really? Does it show? Yeah, a little. Is it Nick trouble? No, not even. It's ridiculous. I'm being ridiculous. Everything is so good, I'm... we're going great. We're just so perfect for each other but nobody has said how they feel yet. Ohh, you mean in terms of the word\" love.\" I did not say that. I'm... I'm gonna get a refill. Be right back. Hi, Nick. Hi, Roni.- Hey.- Your friends are really nice. Good, I'm glad you're having a good time. I am... With you. Oh, I get it. Tradition. I just ruined the moment. No. No, you didn't. I'm trying to tell you that I love you. Well, that's good because I love you too. Hey, guys. Thank God you're back. Give it to me.- Baby.- Mm! Baby, slow down. You're gonna choke. Oh, no, you hurt yourself. I'm fine. Don't worry about it. How are you feeling? Better. The baby's kicking. You want to feel? That's nice. You gotta get some rest. We have to move in the morning again. Oh, God. I can't do this much longer. I thought we were safe here. I did too. I'm sorry. We have an update on the attack at Hadley ranch, bell crossing road. Confirmation of one person killed, livestock mutilated. Medical staging. Rancher claims attack was from an alien, and not the illegal kind. Proceed with caution, potential mental health issues. Damn it. We've got a problem. What? The car won't start. It's either the battery or the starter, I'm not sure.- Well, what are we gonna do?- You're gonna stay here, keep off your feet. I'm going to get us another car. I don't want you to leave me. Baby, I don't want to go either, but we don't have a choice. I love you. We're gonna make it.- Am I late for something?- In a way. I take it this is not about a case? We're talking about a key. I suppose now is as good a time as any. I know there's seven keys. I know they lead to something that was buried in the 13th century. Do you know what it is? What I know is this. The royal families have four of the seven keys. You hold one. That means there are still two that are unaccounted for. Now when the maps of all seven keys are put together, the location of what it is they buried will be known. Those seven crusaders who took it upon themselves to deceive the royal families, they were your ancestors. However, one of the seven would betray the other six. He did so, mind you, only after severe torture. So your ancestors tortured one of mine to get his key. How'd they get the other three? Well, let me just say there was a lot of bloodshed. Even by our standards. Still, it took 600 years to get three more keys. So what's worth all that? Well, that all depends on which legend you believe. In one, it's the secret of alchemy. In another, everlasting life. A third has it associated with the prophet Mohammed's sword, which apparently holds a great deal of power. And lastly, the nails that secured Christ to the cross, and possibly some of those pieces of the cross itself. They are said to hold immense power too. Do we believe this? Seven crusaders felt it was worth their lives not to have what they found fall into the wrong hands. I guess they found something that convinced them. So the question for us would be, can we afford not to believe them? Maybe not. But what are we gonna do about it? Well, for now, make sure to keep my family's hands off your key. So I guess you and your family aren't all that close. My family, as you call them, would have been happier had I never been born. Let me just say that if I stay out of their way, they leave me be. Not that they haven't tried to kill me on occasion. Do you plan to stay out of their way? Well, part of that depends on you. How? Do you trust me? Probably about as much as you trust me. Yeah? Sorry to interrupt, but we have a weird one. A little out of our jurisdiction, but county's requesting assistance. What is it? Cattle mutilations, possible homicide. And here's the fun part. The perp, according to the rancher? He's an alien life form. The truth is out there... East of Portland. Ready when you are. This is where it happened. When I saw John, I knew it was bad. I just hoped to hell he wasn't gonna die. I tried to put him on the atv with me and...- I'm Doug Parcell.- Detective Burkhardt.- Sergeant wu.- Hi. That's our county vet, Kevin Levalle. I got out here to the ranch a little after midnight. Paramedics couldn't do anything about John. There's blood on the atv. Seems to me he must have been hit pretty hard, got pushed back into his own fencepost, pierced his back. He killed six of my cows and he killed John. Now, I swear to God, I don't know what the hell it was. I never saw anything like it before, but it was some kind of alien being. He was glowing. And then I saw him run off that way. Same thing he told me last night. I'm wondering if it's a guy in some kind of mylar coat. I'm telling you, he was glowing. I know how that sounds, but there's no other way to describe it. He do this to all your animals? Yeah. Cut them open. But he didn't do it for the meat. He's right, there was no butchering. It must have been some kind of cult ritual thing. No. What I saw wasn't from this earth. What's he run into if he runs that direction? My fence line is about 3/ 4 of a mile from here.- Mind if we borrow your truck?- No, no. Go ahead. Well, I think we know where he got out. Not very gracefully. That had to hurt. Looks sort of like lizard skin. That'd be a damn big lizard. Well, I appreciate everything you fellas are doing. We'll call you as soon as we learn anything. I just hope you find whatever it was that did this. This is the Hadley ranch. This is where it happened, right? Are you Hadley? No. So you must be looking into the alien attack. Uh, sir, this is a police investigation. Oh, I know, I know. I'm not trying to get in the way. I'm just trying to help out here. For instance, did you know that these attacks have been happening all across the country? Well, here, let me give you my card. George Lazure, alien hunter. Or if you prefer, ufologist. Listen, guys, did anyone get pictures?' Cause I can pay big for an alien photo. Black and white, color, doesn't matter, but digital's best. I'm willing to split with you guys.- No photos, sorry.- Oh, damn. Hey, look, you can level with me. We're all on the same team, really, protecting the people. Was the victim probed? Nobody was probed... Yet.\u266a No, I gotta know\u266a if she'll stick around\u266a When the time comes. Oh!\u266a To put my truck down\u266a then further up the road\u266a we'll park our home You got your***, and***, and your reptilians, from Andromeda. That one. That's what I saw. What have you done? I didn't want her to be able to identify me. She's all right, she's just passed out. She might have had a heart attack. Well, we needed a car. And I didn't know how else to get one. Come on, let's go. You're just gonna leave her here? She's gonna be fine. Look, we need to think about you and the baby now. We're not gonna make it. Hey, hey... Yes, we are. Okay, you gotta be strong for the baby.- It's definitely skin.- Human skin. Well, not precisely. You know, I don't know if I would have even seen this if we hadn't had a power outage. Turn off the lights and I'll show you what I mean. Pretty, huh? What is it? Luciferase. Please tell me that has nothing to do with the devil. It's the enzyme responsible for bio- luminescence. Like fireflies. Also found in many fish and marine invertebrates. It wasn't glowing when we found it. The enzyme usually activates when the animal is agitated. The old fight or flight response. So is it animal or is it human? I don't know. It's human skin with an animal skin response. Burkhardt. Just got a call from the county sheriff. Apparently we have another witness. This one's claiming alien abduction. So are we talking spaceship? No. Bronco. Ah! Aah! I'm sorry, honey, we gotta stay on the back roads. You all right? No! You have to pull over. We gotta make more Miles, we haven't gone that far. I need you to stop, something is wrong. Okay, okay, okay, okay. What can I do? I need to rest. I need to rest for a while. Babe, you said something was wrong. If I don't rest, I'm gonna have this baby right here and now. There's an old cabin over there. I've got an idea. Doesn't look like there's anybody home. I'm gonna check it out. That's it, hold on. Hold on, hold on. I don't think anybody's been here for a long time. Okay. We'll rest here for a while. I'm gonna go hide the car. Vincent... I'm getting hungry again. I'm sorry. No, no, no. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. I know. Uh, I'll see what I can find. But first, I'm gonna start a fire and get this place warmed up. Hey, um, Nick's not here, right? I don't see his car. Uh, no, he's at work as far as I know. Did you try calling him? No, I don't want to talk to him, I want to talk to you. You don't want to go back to the trailer, do you? No, I want to talk about this. Hey! That's a very nice photo. Right? I think. This was taken four years ago and I remember everything about it. Well that's her. Meet Maureen Rodriguez. And she does have a red'78 bronco registered in her name. We're looking for it. Where'd they find her? About two Miles from where that ranch hand was killed and the cattle were mutilated. She was walking down the middle of the road, trying to flag down cars. So something did happen to her. County sheriff checked out her story, found the old barn she said she was taken to. Station wagon parked outside, hood up, broken down, no plates. Which probably means that's our spaceship. We're trying to I. D. the owner based on the VlN. Do me a favor, look into these cattle mutilations. Where they started, what direction they're going. Gotta get ahead of this one. I remembered everything about that night. Where we went, what we did when we were there, that kiss. So that's a good thing. Monroe, I remembered how much I loved him. I could feel it. Then that's a really good thing, right? Or no? Why not? I mean, isn't that what you wanted? I treated him so badly, I'm scared that what I've done would just make it impossible for him to ever love me again. Look, I'm not an expert in these things, although when it comes to you and Nick, I'm certainly privy to more than most... But I just have to tell you, from what I've seen over the past several weeks, nothing suggests that his core feelings for you have faded to any great degree. I'm not so sure. Well, there's only one way to know. Juliette, you have to tell him. I want to but I'm scared. Come on, after all you've been through? Monroe, that's just it. I'm not the same person that I once was and maybe that is not such a good thing. Oh, I kind of think it is. Please just don't repeat any of this to Nick. I'll talk to him when I'm ready. All right. I'll do anything I can to help. There's one thing that might help. Name it. Tell me what a Grimm is. Aa Grimm? A Grimm is someone who can see into the heart of darkness. Someone who sees things other people don't understand.- I can see things that...- That what? That most people can't. He said something like that the night in the trailer. The night that he brought me over to your house. Yeah, I know. So what exactly are you trying to tell me? I'm trying to tell you he's different. Hey, I got the stats on the cattle mutilations you asked for. And? I highlighted the reported ufo attacks. Seems to have started two weeks ago in Lincoln, Nebraska, then moving northwest from there ever since. You can see the frequency of attacks, which total 27, increases as they travel. What is it about cows and aliens? I got nothing.- What?- Have you found them? No. I'm close. She's ready to give birth soon. And when she does, I'll be there. I've got four parties bidding now. A set of three would be worth a fortune. Yeah, I'm working on it. Don't call me again. I'll call you when it's done. Burkhardt. Went by your desk with the lab report, but you're not there. What do you got? Something which finally sheds some real light on the mystery of the cattle mutilations across this country.- While we're young, wu.- Ovaries. Excuse me? That's what was taken from the cows. Their ovaries. Now you know. Yes, I do. What? I don't believe this. They were supposed to be extinct. At least that's what I was told. Well, that wouldn't exactly be in a natural history book. No, these things have a very unnatural history. They were supposedly hunted to extinction. Like the buffalo, their skins were considered very valuable because of their luminescent quality. They were hoarded by collectors. Did you actually see one? No. But I've got two people who say that they've seen aliens. And I've got a piece of glowing skin that can't be categorized as animal or human. When I was a kid, we used to think they were these beautiful, magical creatures that would glow in the dark. It was supposed to be really good luck to see one, you know, like the leprechaun legend. It wasn't so lucky for the ranch hand. Or the mutilated cows.- There were mutilated cows?- Yeah. Six of them. More on other ranches. Give me just... wait, one second. Was anything cut out of them? Their ovaries. There's more than one and she's pregnant. What? There's no way she's doing the hunting on her own. That's who the ovaries are for. Here, here, look. Gluhenvolk are an ancient wesen species with roots that go back to Africa. The gestating female consumes cow ovaries during pregnancy. I know it sounds hinky, but let's just say it's their pickles and ice cream. So he is mutilating cows to get their ovaries to feed to the mother of his soon- to- be- born child. The closer the attack on cows are, the closer she is to popping out a baby Gluhenvolk. There were 27 attacks since they left Nebraska. 27? Seriously? She is gonna go into labor any minute. Rosalee? Oh, hey, Nick. Hey. Ah, I see you two have a book open there, which more likely than not portends some sort of catastrophic disaster, which in turn, can only mean my date with Rosalee has been put on hold. Monroe, there is a Gluhenvolk mutilating cattle for ovaries because he has a pregnant woman about to give birth any minute. Seriously? A Gluhenvolk? Yes. I thought they were extinct. So they're moving along back roads and the last cattle attack was right here. The car was abandoned here and the woman was abducted somewhere along here. If she's as pregnant as I think she is, she can't get very far... not on those roads. My guess, I'd say they're somewhere in here. Right? One road in, one road out. And she's going to need more ovaries. I'm living in an alternate universe. No, you just have a better understanding of the one we're in. Well, I'd better get out there. Nick, we want to go with you. This could be the last of a species, man. We need to help them if we can.- He may have killed a guy.- But the baby is innocent. I know that truck. This guy's been following our Gluhenvolk. Why? He's a ufologist. He may have found them and I gotta find out. Whoa, whoa, hold on. He might be asleep in there, man. Don't you need a warrant for that? You're right. You open it. Oh, okay. Hello? This is a fleshing knife. Um, I don't think this guy's a ufologist.\" Save your skin\"? Must mean literally. If you shot a wesen with this stuff in that bullet... the bullet would kill him, okay? But the even after death.- Forever?- No. This is just temporary. You probably have no more than six or eight hours before you would change back. So he has to harvest and tan the hides very quickly. He does it right here in his trailer. This is so wrong. But you would have a perfectly morphed specimen to sell. We'd better find those Gluhenvolk before he does. How? They're driving a stolen bronco, we didn't pass one on the road, and there was no place to turn off. They've got to be ahead of us somewhere. I'm taking these. What are you doing? Why are you stopping? Nick, do you see something? I think I see a building. Somebody turned off here. The gate's down. Somebody's got a fire going. You smell that? There's only one set of tracks. Somebody went in and didn't come out. Let's check it. Vincent? Damn it. Oh, my God. Oh, get away from me. Please, just take it easy, okay? We're not gonna hurt you. We're here to help. Where's Vincent? What have you done with him? We need you to tell us where he is. Don't hurt me.- Oh, my God.- Don't hurt my baby. It's true. Oh, you're beautiful. Stay away from me! Stay awa... aah! I think she's going into labor. Whoa, Nick, I think you put her over the top. We're gonna need a bunch of stuff we don't have. Oh, the baby's coming. The baby's coming. We're not gonna hurt you at all, we're here to help you. You need to roll onto your back. Oh, my God, her water just broke.- How much time do we have?- Like, none.- Uh...- Uh... I've got a first aid kit in my car. Keep breathing. Hold her head. We're gonna have to spread your legs, okay? Here, now just take hold of my hand. We'll get through this. Ow! I need alcohol wipes for my hands.- Ow, ow, ow, ow.- Monroe! She's, like, breaking my hand.- I can't do this.- You're doing just fine.- I can't do this.- You're doing just great. You're doing great, keep breathing. What's your name? Jocelyn... oh! Okay, jocelyn, my name's Rosalee. This is Monroe and that's Nick.- Nice to meet you.- The baby's crowning. Nick, I'm gonna need you to put counter- pressure with your hands on the small of her back.- Okay.- Okay. All right, jocelyn, we're gonna push. We're gonna push, okay? All right, keep pushing. Here we go. Push. There you go. Push, jocelyn, there you go. Jocelyn? What are you doing? What's going on? The baby's coming. We're, uh, helping, so just join in anytime.- Vincent! Vincent!- Yeah, I'm here, I'm here. Keep pushing. Keep pushing. All right, it's coming. Here it comes. It's coming. I've got the baby. There you go. Oh, you did it. Monroe, will you grab the blanket?- Blanket.- Right there. Oh, here, here, here. It's beautiful. We have a daughter. Yes, we do. One big, happy family. All I want is what I came for. You don't have to get hurt unless you want to. Don't be stupid. What about me? What am I worth? Ooh, more than a Blutbad. What about a Grimm? How much are you worth?- We did it.- It's okay.- What do we do with them?- What do we do with him? We gotta get them out of here. Just get as far away from here as you can. Thanks for everything you guys did for us. Where you headed? There's a few of us left... In Alaska. Good luck. And no more cows, guys. Thanks again. You think they found that guy? Should be there soon. Hopefully before the drugs wear off. Cover right. Hands up! Get your hands up now! What the hell is that? We got it, we got the alien. All right, everybody step back. Move back.

What speed were you doing? Why did you decide to overtake when you did, Tom? I don't know. What...? What happens now? A collision team will start an investigation. If there's enough evidence, a case may be brought to trial. The other car that were in the accident...? The hospital's keeping the driver in for observation, but he should be fine. What about...?

It were that car, weren't it? It were an accident, love! It were an accident! You think I'm stupid? Do you think I don't know he upgraded it? He overtook in the wrong place. Stupid, stupid car!

Are you done? Yeah. No. Ethan was facing prison and the whole time he thought of you. If you don't love him, then let him go, Rachel. I thought you were only going to say one thing. Yeah, well, maths was never my strong point. There's no rush, you know. Are you being funny? No! Like, I mean, there's no hurry. I can call us a lift or something. Yeah, cos that worked out really well last time. I'm joking! Jesus Christ! Yeah, and I just want to say sorry for telling you to fuck off earlier. SHE CHUCKLES What? You must be getting a bit soft in your old age. That is the first time you have ever apologised for anything. And I mean EVER. For as long as I can remember. Yeah, well, don't get used to it. And who are you calling old? Emo slag! Princess. It looks like nothing happened. It's OK, come on. Hiya. Rachel's gone on. I sent Leah to make sure she was OK. Was she expecting you? Um, yeah. HE CLEARS HlS THROAT Yeah, we was going to go to the crash site together, you know. I'm sure she just forgot. You know how Rachel is. Yeah, yeah, I'll just.. I'll just meet them down there. It's time, Ethan. What is? To let our Rachel go. Rachel's not the same girl you started going out with. She looks the same, sometimes she even sounds the same... but there's some days I think we lost our daughter that day... Susanna, please... I'm grateful... We got a second chance. So did Rachel. And so should you. It's time to let her go. It's hard... And after the accident..... poor old Rach, she couldn't even remember who we was. And four months ago, she couldn't even walk. Just look at her now. She's... she's getting there, yeah? You can't keep hoping it'll be the same as it was before. It's not like that. It's just..... I love her. You know, I loved her then and... I love her now. I still love her, Susanna. SHE SlGHS Hey. You know this is the first time I've been back here since the crash? You know, I still can't remember anything, nothing from the crash, nothing from the day. You know, maybe that's for the best. I don't want to forget anything! I just don't want to lose anyone else. It's my birthday in a month, so you can give it to me then. OK. What are you doing here? You've been avoiding us all year, mate, and this is it, yeah? You shouldn't be here. He's a right to be here. No, we have a right to be here, you don't! I asked him here. It's what Kate would have wanted. What, so you're speaking on behalf of the dead now, are you? Me, Kate and Ashley were friends long before any of you came along! I think I know them so, yes, I am speaking for them! Yeah, well, fuck him, all right, cos he's not worth it! This is all your fault! Ashley, Kate and Brian are dead because of you! Why did you overtake that car? I don't know. I lost my sister because of you! Leah... Everything about her's different. You know, what she likes, what she doesn't like! You didn't lose me. Leah! You didn't lose me! You know I was the one that arranged that night out. Why did you overtake that car? It wasn't one thing. I just thought I'd put... I don't know. You just do what you do best, yeah, Tom. Just run away. Just like you did at the hospital, just like you did at Katie's funeral, yeah? I was afraid! Yeah?! Well, Katie's family needed you there, mate! How could I be with you and not see her? HE CRlES How could I be with you and not see her and know that it was my fault? HE CRlES And I keep saying that I'm sorry, over and over again, and it doesn't help! It doesn't bring Brian back and it doesn't make you better! And it doesn't help my mum and dad and I don't know what else to do! Right, get up. I can't. Come on! You've got to get up! I can't, I can't any more. My mum, you know, you know what she said? She said I broke her heart. And I want to fix things for her but I can't. I want to make things better and I just can't. You can't and that's the point. You just have to learn to live with the loss. And you can't do that by locking yourself away. Or hiding from everyone who reminds you of Kate. Have you visited her grave? No. Do you know what? I was exactly the same at the start. But now I like to visit her. You know, sometimes, I look around and I would see her standing there. I wish I could see her. Just once more! You hear about that all the time, people seeing someone they've lost, but I haven't seen her once! I haven't even dreamt about her. I think I'm going to forget what she looks like. You have to forgive yourself. You knew her. She has. Visit her grave, it's what she would want. Why do you even care? Because we're friends and friends stick up for each other. You know, I lost my best friend! And I don't want to lose anyone else! Do you know if we remember them, then, they're not really dead?

Yeah, my underwear makes me feel like I'm sitting on a cloud. And you have to take my word for that. Looks like this Blanca's really working out, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Gotta respect her, man. Took her eight years to get her Green Card. Mm- hmm. Most people never get their Green Cards. Right, well, we checked everybody around here, right? Oh, sure, sure, sure. Sales, H. R., Accounting... Everybody on the loading dock? Cashiers, Marketing, Management... And everyone on the loading dock? I'm sure everything's fine. J. J. runs a tight ship down there. Which means you don't know because you never checked, did you, Ed? I make it a policy not to go looking for trouble. That's why I don't have prostate exams. Well, next time you got your head up there, look around. If we're violating Immigration laws, we're subject to big fines, Ed. Look, a company as big as ours is bound to use some undocumented workers. I mean, there's a lot of jobs to fill. They're affordable, hardworking, and honest. If they're so honest, why are they willing to go under the floor of a van to get in this country? They're just trying to better their lives. You'd do the same. You'd go to hell and back for your family. That's the problem-- they never go back. Where you going, Mike? Well, I'm gonna try H. R. first. If there's a mess downstairs, I gotta try to clean this up. Well, good luck trying to clean up something in this country without using illegals. Come on! Let's move! We have ten minutes to unload that truck, because there's another one right behind it! Let's go! Look how J. J. has this place humming. It's like synchronized swimming. I bet swimming is how some of these guys got here. Hey, look, it's Management! Everybody look busy! Oh, wait. We already are,' cause I'm doing my job. Ed, Mike. You guys get lost on the way to the golf course? Actually, we're down here looking for a caddy. Yeah.- How's it going, man?- Great. Hey, check out the hands on Martinez. I think we found the second baseman for our softball team. Oh, no, no, no. I'm the second baseman. Why don't we have this awkward conversation later? I'm sorry for interrupting, J. J., but we have to check everyone's work documents. What's going on, Ed? Never bothered me about this stuff before. Well, it's actually not Ed's idea.- It's for me. I hope you don't mind.- Yeah. Well, I kind of do. You pay me to get these trucks out on time. It's gonna take forever for these guys to find all their... Papers. Okay. Uh, let's go, guys. Guys, I appreciate it. H. R. needs to take a look at'em.- I'll have'em right back to you.- Okay, I've got six right here. All right. So we got everybody's?- Thanks, guys.- Mike. Uh... Sorry. It's gonna be a real drag losing J. J. He's been around Outdoor Man for over ten years. I've known him longer than I've known Eve. Honey, Eve's 14. Yeah, but she wasn't all that interesting till after she was 5. You know, aren't you the one who's always saying illegal immigrants are breaking the law, hence the word\" illegal\"? I know, but he's part of the Outdoor Man family. He's practically part of our family. Gosh, remember that time that he dressed up like the Easter Bunny for the kids? Yeah. Tripped over the garden hose on the way out, head popped off. Mandy to this day thinks rabbits have Mexicans inside of them. Hey, you know what? I think you have a lot of Mexican inside you.- Why?- Couldn't stop eating Blanca's burritos. Man. Those didn't have meat. There was just beans in'em. They were great. It's, uh... It's gonna be a rough night, isn't it? I should just apologize in advance, shouldn't I? Yeah, you should. You know, poor J. J. Boy, two kids, no job. And finding a job that's even close to the one he had, it's gonna be impossible. It's nuts.- Mm.- And then look at Blanca. She did it the right way, legally, went through channels, became a citizen, you know? Boy, can she cook. Wow. Mmm. Mm. Oh! Mike! God! Control yourself! Get some matches. So wait. Blanca's not even coming here today? She was here yesterday.- She'll be here tomorrow.- So she's not coming at all? But she didn't even finish my Spanish homework. Blanca's doing your Spanish. I'm doing your history. You know, you should really tell your teachers they're giving us too much homework. Hey, why don't I get that? Yeah, I'll get it. You know,'cause I'm up. Uh... Hey, yeah. Power to the people, man.- Hey.- What's up, Larabee? Hey, Baxter. I heard you got yourself a maid. Yeah, well, you know, property values plummeted when you moved in. I'm trying to spruce it up on the inside. Are you sure it's not because of that hillbilly truck you always got parked out front with the gun rack? Anyway, Carol found out about your maid, and, uh, now we have to get one, too, so thanks for that. What am I supposed to do? Not make my wife happy to save you a few bucks? Well, I'd appreciate that, yeah. And you wandered down from your house just to tell me that? No, no, not quite. Is Kristin around? Oh, hey, Mr. Larabee. Come on in. Hey, hey. Just came by to drop off the key. What's the key for? To my house. My housekeeper can't get in the house without a key. Hou-- housekeeper? Uh, hey, I gave you first dibs on my services. His house doesn't have a bunch of slobby kids. You got a problem with her cleaning my house, Mike? I got a problem with her cleaning any house she doesn't live in. You could pay me what you pay Blanca. Oh, that's what this is about-- Oh, so you trying to steal my maid, Baxter? She's not your maid. I'll just leave you two to sort this out. See you, Kristin. And thanks, Mike. You know, this housekeeper thing isn't just making my wife happy. I'm suddenly pretty happy about it, too. Hey, Ed. Did you take care of everything in the loading dock? I'm promoting Raphael to foreman. Raphael? Yeah, the guys seem to look up to him. Must be the fur around his license plate. Ed. Mike. Hey, J. J. Just came by to return my badge... And my gun. I scanned a lot of bar codes with this baby. I really just came by to say good- bye. Yeah, well, I'm sorry it went down like this, J. J. We're gonna miss you. Oh, don't worry about me. I've got a cousin in Amarillo, got me a job as a dishwasher at a truck stop on I- 10. Get a dog and a cheatin' girlfriend, you got a country song. It's honest work. Do what I do for my family. Yeah. This is nuts, J. J. This is nuts, man. Oh, hey, it's okay, Mike. I'm thankful for the ten years I had. You're a great boss. And you're a great foreman. But you're not a dishwasher, man. You're really not a dishwasher. I've seen the coffee cup you leave in the sink here. It's got this crust on you can't even get off. Do me a favor. Just hang here for a little bit. Let me have a talk with Ed. Maybe go try to wash that cup off. What are you thinking? I'm thinking we need him on the loading dock. He's too valuable. You gotta keep him somehow. That's easier said than done, Mike. That's... No. You know what? Yesterday I looked at the Immigration web site, and there's a way you can keep him here under sponsorship if they're vital to our business. That's gonna cost a lot of money. Well, you got a lot of money, and it was your problem. You're the one that started this, and you gotta fix this. Well, okay. You know, this-- this just could work out. This could work out. Remember I have-- I have that great Immigration lawyer? All right. Remember my psycho girlfriend Svetlana?- Yeah, well, how great is he?- Yeah. He got her shipped back to Ukraine. That's right, and that wasn't easy, because she was born in Kansas. Hey. Hi, Blanca. Oh, hello, Mr. Mike.- How are you today?- I'm good. Wow, you look very happy. You know what? I am very happy. Like my uncle after he picked grapes all day and made enough money to buy a whore. Hmm. I don't know that I'm, uh, whore- happy. But I might have saved a guy's job today. And that's a really good feeling. Oh, work is good. A man needs work. Yeah. Hey, Blanca, I need two dozen cookies for a bake sale. Make your own cookies. There's a tube of crap in there that turns into cookies. Can't Blanca make'em from scratch? It'll show how I really care. Oatmeal raisin, por favor. Okay. It's okay, Mr. Mike. I don't mind. I like doing things for people. Well, you got a very good work ethic, that's why. Well, you can't afford to be lazy in my country. You know, when my brother refused to clean my uncle's fishing boat, they buried him in the sand up to his neck, rubbed a fish on his head, and left him to los gatos de la playa. Los gatos de la playa... Beach cats? S\u00ed. And those cats are not nice kitties. I like what I'm hearing. I like what I'm hearing. And I'm not usually a cat guy. Ah, hey.- Hi, baby.- What a day at work. Nice to see a friendly face. Yeah, I know what you mean. I was talking about Blanca. So was I. Oh... Here's your dress, Miss Mandy. I fixed the hem and sewed on a button. Aw. You didn't have time to iron it? Oh, well, it's faster to steam it. Come. We'll hang it in the shower. You see what's happening here? We're paying someone to teach our kids how not to work. We can't continue this way with Blanca. Honey, what are you suggesting? I am not giving her up. I can't go back.- Hey, hey, hey...- No, I can't. Oh, hey, Boyd, honey, you dropped your napkin. It's okay. Blanca will pick it up. Hold it. Ho, ho, ho. Get over here a second. What do you mean,\" Blanca will pick it up\"? What are you talking about? She's my clean- up girl. Oh, is she? Oh. Hold on a second. Hey, Blanca, would you bring the girls? Girls, girls, get in here a second!- Mike. Mike, honey, Mike, please...- Just-- just give me a second. Just don't do anything rash, all right? If you gotta get rid of somebody, pick one of the kids. Blanca, just for a second. Listen. Girls, you're part of this, too. You do a great job around here. What you've done is turned my kind of lazy girls into real lazy girls. Um, in fairness to Blanca, though, I was already pretty lazy. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to treat my kids like your uncle treated your brother. Well, you don't mean... Release the beach cats. I wanna start with Boyd and that paper he dropped on the floor. Okay. Mijo, pick that up. Put it in the trash. Eve, preheat the timer for 350 and take out the cookie dough. Mandy, go upstairs, start the shower to steam your dress. Let's go! Move it! Come on! R\u00e1pido!- But, Blanca, I...- Ah- ah- ah! And if anyone talks back to me, I will laugh as the cats claw out your eyes!- Not my eyes!- All right, hey, hey. You might wanna tone down the cat- eye- scratching thing. No. I will do the... Mm. I love that show. Yeah. We totally have to come up with an idea for\" Shark Tank.\" Mm- hmm.- We should invent a giant glass bowl...- Okay.- And fill it with water...- Yeah. Where predatory sea creatures could live.- Hmm. Pretty good.- Yeah. I like it. I don't, like, love it, but... Oh, my God. Oh! You were describing an actual shark tank!- Oh, wow.- Uh, chicas...- Huh?- Let's go. limpia todo.- Sorry. Rec\u00f3gelo. R\u00e1pido, r\u00e1pido. No quieres los beach cats.

You've been breathing in barf's gas again.- Yeah, so?- Guys, guys. Barf and belch is one dragon. You have to use one signal at a time.- Good idea. Barf, attack tuffnut. Heh, how was that?- I don't think it's what hiccup--- Belch, eat ruffnut.- [ groans ] uh, ow.- Tuff, come on.- Whatever. Belch, drop ruffnut.- [ shudders ] ugh. I can't work like this.- Ugh, it's completely unprofessional.- I'm taking my dragon and going home.- You touch that dragon, and I'll--- You'll what?- I... I don't know. Don't rush me. Just, uh... Uh... Tell you tomorrow.- Ugh, come on, barf.- Guys, come on. Stop, please. Leave the dragon out of it. It's over.- Oh, it's over.- Yeah, it's so over, it's under.- What was that about?- Eh, they'll be back.- Agh, suck in your gut, stoick.- It's sucked, gobber. It doesn't suck any more than this.- Ah, the ceremonial belt. Is it that time again?- Yep. Tomorrow's the annual treaty signing With the berserker tribe.- They gotta change that name. When your chief's osvald the agreeable And you haven't been to war in 50 years--- Please tell me he's not bringing That lunatic kid of his.- Dagur? Oh, he'll be here.- Oh, great, and let me guess, I get to keep him from breaking things.- Actually, I have a more important job for you. You get to hide all the dragons.- From osvald the agreeable? Why?- Hiccup, just because we've had peace for 50 years Doesn't mean they still can't go, well--- Berserk?- Exactly. The dragons could be seen as a sign of aggression. Better blissful than bloody, I always say.- And the last thing we want Is another berserker skirmish. They tend to play for keeps.- Just hide the dragons, son.- Back in line! Back in line! Everybody, in line, in line. Is dagur coming? He's so cool.- Cool? Last time he was here, He used me as a knife- throwing target.- That guy should be locked up in a cage.- That's what he did to me. He wouldn't let me eat for three days. Then he force- fed you rotten cod heads.- Thanks. I almost erased that from my memory.- Look out, incoming zippleback!- Where's ruffnut and tuffnut? Someone get that dragon.- I'm on it.- Snotlout, you need two riders. Fishlegs, get in there.- Ha, I'm not sure this is really the best-- I don't feel so good.- It's the gas. Just try not to breathe any in.- Yeah, that ship has sailed.- Whoa. Oh, hey! Somebody tell me how to work this thing!- Whatever you do, snotlout, don't spark.- Okay, now I feel worse.- Then if I were you, I would not think about that rotten cod head Sliding down your throat.- Oh, that is disgusting. Wait here. I need to find the twins To get that zippleback under control before the berserkers-- [ horn bellows ]- are here.- Great. Just great.- Hey, dad... There's something--- not now, son. Osvald is here.- Presenting the high chief of the berserker tribe-- Cracker of skulls, slayer of beasts, The great and fearsome...- Osvald the agreeable?- Dagur the deranged!- Dagur?- Deranged?- Oh, no.- Hyah!- Oh, perfect.- Dagur, where is your father?- My father has been retired. He lost his taste for blood. So... Where are you hiding them, stoick?- Hiding what, dagur?- Do I look stupid to you?- Trick question. Don't answer it.- We both know what's going on here. I have it on excellent authority That you're amassing an army of dragons.- Excellent authority? And who would that be, dagur?- Never mind. Just know that if I find it to be true, Then my armada will attack with the force Of 50, 000 brave berserker soldiers.- Stand down, dagur. There won't be any need for the armada. Now let's get to the treaty.- Yes. Let's. According to the treaty, My visit starts with a tour of berk, The armory, the feast in the great hall, The killing arena. You do still kill dragons here, hmm?- Your father never found the tour necessary.- As you can see, I'm not my father. Am I?- Not in front of the armada.- Ah, this is bad, this is bad. This is really bad. I have to find that zippleback.- Hiccup, we have a problem.- Oh, yeah? You're telling me. Dagur's the new berserker chief.- What?- Yeah, his father\" retired.\" And he thinks we're hiding dragons.- Well, we kind of are. Which brings us to our next problem.- And we're walking, walking. Here, we have our food storage. It's where we, well...- Oh, oh, let me guess-- Store your food.- No wonder they made him chief.- Barf, belch, come back here!- Bo- ring! I want see the dragon killing things.- Follow me.- Where did it go?- I have no idea. Uh, you keep looking, and I'll go warn my dad.- You want some of this, gronckle? Unh! How'bout you, nadder? Unh! That's right, plead! Plead for your pathetic dragon life!- He's really got a handle on that whole deranged thing.- I'm about to make him eat this sword.- Why don't we see to signing that treaty now?\" sign the treaty, dagur.\" leave that chicken alone, dagur. Ooh, put down that axe, dagur!\"- Your father is a great man, And I'll not have you disrespect him. I intend to return the berserkers To their former glory-- Something he was incapable of doing.- Zippleback.- I knew it! Where is it?- [ laughs ]- oh, let me kill it!- He's joking, dagur.- Let me kill it!- That stoick, always the prankster. Tell me, dagur, what are some of your deranged plans For the berserker tribe?- [ quietly ] barf? Belch? Guys, you can't be here. Oh, come on, what did they do? Okay. Uh, think like ruffnut and tuffnut. I can't believe I just said that. Barf, belch, sky!- Nice weapons, very clean, no blood stains. Pity. Ah, hiccup, there you are. Dagur! I was just thinking about you. Hey, remember that time we went swimming, And you tried to drown me? Oh, the laughs we had. Bored again! Just a moment. Something is going on here.- I can explain- where is it?- Look, it's just one drag--- your leg. Never mind. I heard all about it.- You heard all about what?- You. The red death. Defeated it all on your own.- Me? Look at me. How is that even possible?- Right? That's what I thought too. But then I heard about the trained dragons, And it got me, well, kind of tingly.- Trained dragons? I do-- I don't even-- how would you train a dragon?- All right, then, who's hungry?- It's this way, dagur.- Arrgh, aaaar. Oh, boy, am I hungry. Get that dragon out of here. [ dragons growling ]- We need the twins.- What are you guys doing here?- Hey, tuffnut, feel like talking?- Um, can you come down?- Whatever. Whoa, yeah. I love that part.- Look, about barf and belch-- We need you and ruffnut To help us get your dragon under control.- Uh- uh. No. No, thank you. I am officially out of the dragon business. And the sister business. And the dragon and sister business.- What's going on with you two?- Simple. You know what this is?- Uh, a spoon? And our well- groomed stuffed yak. Just once I want something to be just mine. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go pack up my half of the yak.- Go? Where?- I don't know, To my dark, soggy alone place, Not to cry. This house has too many memories.- Tuff!-\" dark, soggy alone place\"? Ugh.- Yeah, I really don't want to know.- Did you get that zippleback under control?- We're working on it.- A toast to death in battle.- To your father!- To osvald!- To osvald!- Fine. Whatever.\" to osvald! To osvald! To osvald!\" Bladdity bladdity blah! Unh!- Well, on that cheery note, Shall we sign the treaty and send you on your way?- Great idea! Let's sign that treaty. Bring us the dragon's blood!- Uh, did you say dragon's blood?- Heh heh. Don't be ridiculous, dagur. Your father and I haven't signed a treaty in dragon's blood For years.- Why would that be a problem, stoick? Unless, of course, you don't kill dragons anymore.- We still kill dragons.- The problem is we've killed so many, There isn't a dragon within 200 miles-- Except that one.- The zippleback! It's a sign! A head for each chief! [ laughs ] It's gonna be amazing. Tonight we hunt dragon! [ whoosh, thud ]- Yeah! Yeah! Kill!- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!- You need to find that zippleback before he does.- Hiccup, you heard tuffnut. He went to his dark, soggy alone place. That could be anywhere.- Not really. That could only be one place. What?- Why didn't you say something?- Why didn't you ask?- Snotlout, we've been looking for them all day.- And?- And if you don't tell us Right now, I'm gonna throw you off that dragon!- No need to get violent. He's probably at the lost cavern. They used to play\" hide and go kill\" there When they were kids.- Astrid, you and snotlout take the south entrance Of the cavern. Fishlegs and I will take the north.- Let's go. Ugh.- All right, bud, do your thing. Search.- Pretty dark in here. If you need to hold my hand, astrid, it's okay.- Sure, snotlout.- Ooh, soft as I thought it would be.- Tuffnut?- Oh, you guys again. Would you quit following me!- Ruffnut!- Would you quit following me!- Did you guys hear that?- Duh. It's called an echo.- Toothless, plasma blast!- Okay, listen, please. We need to get you guys To your dragon-- it's important.- Barf and belch are in real trouble.- I'll go, but not with her. Yeah! Wait. What?- You don't understand, you both have to go. Guys, listen. Like it or not, you're connected to each other. And the two of you are connected to that dragon. Just like me with toothless.- And me with stormfly.- Us too.- We can get you another spoon, Another dish, another stuffed yak. What we can't get you is another barf and belch.- Do you think they got any of that?- Fine. [ both spit ] You know, I did spit a little more in my hand.- They got it.- Okay, let's go. We're out of time.- So why is this so important, anyway?- The berserkers are hunting down your dragon To use its blood for ink. What? Is that not what's happening?- There they are. We gotta get you guys down there.- No! What are we doing here? We have to get our dragon.- We can't afford to be spotted by the berserkers. How dare you.- How dare you? We're supposed to slay this dragon together, And that's what we'll do... In the arena, where dragon killing is done.- To the arena!- The chiefs aren't gonna let them Kill our dragon... Both: Is he?- He won't have a choice, unless we can figure out a plan.- I have a plan. One word-- Annihilate! Uhh! Hookfang!- Or not.- Actually, that could work.- According to the treaty, The killing of the dragon...- [ yawns ]- Must be--- bored. I want the head on the right.- I'm putting a stop to this. If it means war, it means war.- Help! Dragon attack!- The dragons are attacking!- What is going on?- Gobber... Dragon attack!- Oh. Dragon attack! Everyone out of here!- Run! Run! Move out of the way!- We must protect our honored guests.- Run if you want, But dagur the deranged will not retreat!- Barf, gas.- Belch, spark. [ growling ]- back, you... Fiend, you! You'll not harm my friend dagur. Please, dagur, save yourself.- You owe it to your people!- Berserkers, to the boats!- What about the treaty?- Consider it signed!- Well done, hiccup. I doubt we'll be seeing much more of dagur the deranged.- Let's hope not. I used to think that four heads was a little crazy. And I wasn't wrong.- I still think dagur's pretty cool.- But I'll still take crazy over berserk Any day of the week", "imdb_url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2700596", "imdb_id": "tt2700596", "year": "2013", "rated ": "TV-PG", "genre": "Animation, Action, Adventure", "plot": "When Ruffnut and Tuffnut have a falling out, Hiccup and the kids must reunite them before their wayward Zippleback is discovered by Dagur the Deranged, the visiting chief from the fearsome Berserker tribe.", "language": "N/A", "country": "N/A", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExMTA0MDU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMwODQ1MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "imdbRating": "7.6", "type": "episode"}
{"title": "1600 Penn Pilot", "content": "This is a day of destiny. The day we stand up against our tormenters. They think they're so cool because of the cool things they do and say. And their hair. But we've taken enough harassment from these guys. Their hair looks so effortless. They trashed our house, mocked us all over campus... One of them stole Mike's girlfriend.- I still love her.- Mike still loves her. But now... we exact our revenge. Wait. What are we doing, exactly? Step 1: we set off the fireworks display on their lawn. Step 2: it scares the crap out of them. This is such a good plan. Gather water! The prank has gone wrong! Is everybody out? This is a serious situation! They got Doug! Stop chasing me! Fire is our common enemy right now!( grunts) Oh, hey, guys. College, am I right? What a crazy time in our lives. Meatball is in the oven. SKlP: Sourced By: Deafdude 1600 PENN S01 Ep01- Putting Out Fires Sync and corrected by dr. jackson for www. addic7ed. com Early this morning, the President received word of an incident on the college campus of his oldest son Standrich, known by all of us, affectionately, as Skip. Has Skip received any kind of preferential treatment in this matter? He has not nor will not receive any special treatment because his father's the President. In fact, most people meet Skip and forget that his father's the President.( laughter) You all have a good day. WOMAN: I'm so proud of all you girls. And I know if my stepdaughter Becca were here...... she would say the same thing. So... do any of you girls have any questions? Yes. What does it mean when my dad says you're a trophy wife? Well, do you have any trophies? Yeah. For winning in soccer. And I'm sure you're very proud of that soccer trophy. Because trophies aren't just pretty. They denote Like putting yourself through law school, running a dozen successful political campaigns by the age of 40, and still managing to get to the gym three days a week-- and I mean real classes, not just standing there on the elliptical. So if your dad has any further thoughts on trophies, wives or otherwise, I think you should show him your soccer trophy and tell him to shove... Oh, no! We are so out of time. Let's multiply. Yay! SAVANNAH: So, no Becca. Hopefully she'll have time for our interview later. Of course. Though we may have to pull her away from volunteering at the soup kitchen or teaching Japanese to little Japanese children. Where's Becca?( sighs) 20 on Miss Perfect?( sighs) Ew. Okay... Is it plus? It's plus. Bad brand. This is the first time you don't want to ace a test. Come on! Perfect. And finally, Mr. President, we're implementing your insurance reforms. Good job, everybody. Now we just gotta keep our eye on the ball. Two dozen Latin American leaders arrive today, and they are not leaving until they approve my trade deal. If you'll excuse me, I have to go talk some sense into my son. Hey. So how was the event with Becca? She bailed on me. I'm not sure why, but I'm guessing it's because I'm still the evil stepmom. But don't worry. I'm gonna win her over. She's gonna love me whether she likes it or not. That's the spirit. I think.- MARSHALL: Sir.- Whoa. After the Latin American leaders arrive, you have that\" friendly\" game of tennis with the Brazilian president. Where I let him win. I got it. And the First Lady arranged for Skip to record a fire safety video. Yeah, I figured he could be like... a role model. SKlP( imitating President): Son, I'm disappointed in you about this fire. But deep down inside, I know that you are awesome. That is why I have appointed you Chief Astronaut.( as himself): No, Dad, I can't accept it.( as President): You must. For this nation! And for these ladies. Where did you guys come from? Hi, I'm Skip. Tell me, have you always been Asian? Why the pregnant pause? Come here, sister! I am in so much trouble! Yeah. So much history here, right? Roosevelt, Superman... Skip... let me ask you something. You've had to, um... you know, deliver a lot of rough news to Dad over the years, right? Tons of times. I'm kind of an expert at it. Do you have some kind of special technique, or... Let's role- play. I've been work- shopping a pretty killer impression of Dad. That's not really what I had in mind. Okay.( as President): Becca... you are an amazing, brilliant human being. Skip is right to be suspicious. You my favorite. Well, Dad, I really need... why am I indulging this? You sound nothing like Dad.( door opens) PRESlDENT: Skip, don't sit in my chair. That's actually not that bad. Maybe try it a little gruffer, like you're an angry cowboy... Dad! Momily... Aw, Skip. Nothing fazes you. Not even the things that should. I'm unflappable. All right, Skip, can you sit down for a second? Skip, I think it's time for you to come home from school. Seven years of college is plenty. I'm three credits shy of graduating. You said that last year. Doesn't make it less true. Mrs. Gilchrist, Xander and Marigold's school is on the line. Hello? Yes, Ms. Esslinger. What seems to be the prob... Uh- huh. Yes. She's right here. BECCA: Sorry about that... Yes, we will talk to them. Thank you. Xander and Marigold were sent home from school for fighting. They have an armed escort. Who are they fighting? BOY: Becca! Marigold, you've betrayed me for the last time! Don't be so dramatic. I'm going to betray you lots more times. Knuckle noogie!- Dad, make her stop!- PRESlDENT: Enough. Couch. Now.( whispering): You seriously hurt me. I am shocked. Do you two want to get kicked out of school? We'd be better off. It's a fascist institution. What's going on with you guys? I don't want to talk about it. Fine. Then go to your rooms. And Skip, can you head upstairs? Emily and I have a little project for you.( whispering): I love projects. I'll talk to Xander and Marigold. See if I can break through to them.( scoffs) Becca, don't scoff. It's not called the Oval Scoffice. Oh, God. Do better, Emily. PRESlDENT: Come on... Isn't it nice to have everybody under one roof again? I miss it. I wish that we could go out for pizza like the old days. With Mom? Dad, um... can we talk? Sir, the Latin Americans are gathering outside. You only have a few minutes before De Soto arrives. Sorry, Becca, today is... well, actually it's just about like every other day. Can it wait? Yeah.( sighs) I know this jacket makes me look skinny, but it makes me feel fat. All you have to do is read, Skip. No. I want to do so much more. I'm going to make my dad proud, Marshall Mathers. I'm going to make love to that audience. No, not in like a dirty way. I mean like in a romantic comedy from the'80s, when somebody's like,\" Hey, I want to marry you,\" and the other person's like,\" No.\" And then they're like,\" I'm gonna get on that plane,\" and the other person's like,\" You can't get on that plane.\" Oh, wait. You can. Security hasn't taken precautions post- 9/ 11 yet.\" Skip. Skip... It feels like... It's just 30 seconds of text. I just... I don't like your tone. Mr. President, many of us would support your trade agreement, but we are under terrific pressure from Brazil to vote against you. Yeah, De Soto has a little ax to grind. Ever since that G20 incident. America wins!( gasping for air) Ah,( bleep). It was regrettable, and, uh... Skip, please. You can do this. It's just, I've said the word\" fire\" so many times, it just sounds so weird to me now.- Fahyer. Fower? Fahherrr...- Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. How about this? Let's just pretend like the camera's not even here. See, Marshall, now that's helpful. Hi. I'm Skip Gilchrist, You may know me from such things as the White House...- Skip. Skip!- What? You have to look at the camera. You said pretend it's not there. Know it's there, but pretend like it's not there. There... not there. Marshall, you sound like a crazy person. I'm sorry that De Soto has made it personal, but this deal is good for all of us. Hmm.... let's fight fire with fire safety. I think we got it! Oh, no. Oh, no! President De Soto, welcome to the United States. I just hope to avoid bodily injury. We'll keep you out of harm's way. Maybe try a little bit harder? SKlP: I'm so sorry! Guys, guys! As I said, Skip is deeply sorry about fire.( reporters shouting) Both fires. Can we please move on to literally any other topic?- I really doubt it.- You know what else is on fire? The American auto industry. Anything? OK, first of all, I'm crazy sorry. The frat house fire, real boner move. We talked about that earlier. But this second fire, it's a freak thing. If anything, it's because I was trying too hard to do what you asked. I'm not blaming you, but... Skip. Do you know why I decided to you should move back here? So that I could be surrounded by people who can keep an eye on me? Absolutely. But also, this can be a new phase in your life. A chance for you to become a doer of things, rather than a man to whom things are done. To be the lion, and not the gazelle. To be a man... a man, Skip. Oh, my God. I love you so much. Okay. You and I are different. In a lot of ways, you're more like your mother. She had a spark, you know? A way with people I never had, and you have that, too. I have a spark. All I ask is that you use that spark for something other than setting things on fire. Sir? You good with the game plan? De Soto's champ because I whipped him on his turf, so now I let him whip me on mine-- hatchet buried. Though I'd rather send him home with a racket down his Panama Canal... Enrique! I'm about to do to you what China did to your manufacturing sector. Ha- ha.( yells)( grunts) You got lucky on that one, Enrique. Luck is for Americans. I'm gonna treat you like you treated your indigenous peoples.( grunts)( crowd groans) SKlP: No, Dad. Aah! Come on! He needs... a spark. May... hey, may I have your attention, please? Thank you. My dad didn't fight his way across Iraq in the Desert Storm operations to lose a battle on our soil. Dale won't fail; I just need one other person to not make this not feel so awkward. That's perfect. You'll be great. Dale won't fail. Dale won't fail. ALL( chanting): Dale won't fail. SKlP: Feel it! Dale won't fail. Dad, I'm using my spark! Based on our conversation. Be the lion, not the Gisele. It's your serve, Dale won't fail. Dale won't fail.( laughs) U. S. A.-- let's switch it up. U. S. A.-- yeah, more pride. CROWD: U. S. A. U. S. A. That's it!- U. S. A. U. S. A.!- Now, let me feel it.- U. S. A.- Back row. U. S. A. U. S. A. U. S. A. U. S. A.! U. S. A. ALL: Ooh! Maybe we have a match after all.( whooping) Becca, Becca. Look, I didn't want to get into it this morning in front of your father, but you and I have got to talk. We've been over and ovary this. What did you just say? I mean let's fetus facts. Will we always get along? Maybe, baby not. But you have to come to term with the idea that I'm here, uterus dilated single mother. What? You and I are related one way or the other. I can't deal with this. Where are you going?( sighs) I am going to talk to Xander and Marigold about why they're fighting. Well, that's... why I'm here. Is it? Becca, I don't want to get into a competition with you.( crowd cheering) SKlP: Match point. Go, Dad! MARSHALL: Sir! Sir. The plan? It's just so much patriotic chanting. It's intoxicating. All you have to do is lose this tiebreaker. He'll be happy and he'll stop blocking the deal. SKlP: Papa! Jimmy here is your# 1 fan. His one wish was to come to the White House. You're his hero. I believe in you, President Gilchrist. Oh, come on. So, that's why they were fighting. Pretty shocking, huh? Yes, I know, I know. Yeah, I mean Xander told me everything. Marigold told me... yeah, the whole thing. Well, I don't want to betray her confidence, so what did Xander say? Marigold didn't tell you anything, did she? Not a word. Xander has a crush on some girl named Jessica. Marigold was giving him a hard time about it. Good try though. Damn it.( yells)( coughing) Ooh, uh...( blows air) Woo-- so how we celebrating this victory, huh? Thinking something small, Rose Garden, no plus ones? Mr. President, you mark my words, I will not be humiliated again. I've said that a lot of times. Always comes back to bite me. Skip, stop talking. The president was supposed to lose this game. It was the key to a big trade deal. I was just trying to help. It's okay, Skip. I think you've done enough helping today. I really was trying this time, you know? I can't believe I let him down again. Please. Oh, Skip is coming. When I'm stressed, I snack. Me, too. Thank goodness we both have amazing metabolisms. I'm making a salad. Think I'll have a...... salad. So, why are you snacking? I just wish people would be more upfront. Preaching to the choir. Every time I try to talk to Becca about our stuff, she runs away. Then you should speak to her somewhere she can't run. That's how I got Cara Niam to give me a definitive\" no\" on prom, you know, so I could make other plans. You know what, Skip? You're right. It's better to just put yourself out there. That's what you do. You should never be ashamed of that. Dad, sorry I let you down. I'll make it up to you.( imitates Dale): Oh, Skip, you're my best friend.( men arguing indistinctly) SKlP: Hola. Agua may llama Skip, and I just want to say I am sorry for screwing up your trade agreement. MAN: Skip Gilchrist. You threw a flaming chair at our colleague, the leader of Brazil, President Enrique Hernando Feliz Navidad De Soto. I know and I just want to say that... Nice work. Come. Drink with us. There's nothing girls can't achieve when it comes to math and science. Yet only 20% of engineering students are women. So, why did you two team up for this? Well, originally when I began my degree, I remember... Actually, there was a story that touched us both. We heard about a math class that lost its teacher. What happened was a very talented student- teacher stepped up and taught the class for a while, but then the school found a sub. Unfortunately, the sub had no clue how to handle the class. The sub felt she could do a good job if she wasn't constantly being undermined by the student teacher. The student teacher probably felt that the sub took the job for all the wrong reasons. Is the wrong reason love?( laughs) Of math... and science? What was that? A metaphor. Who cares? At least we're finally talking about it. You want to talk? Let's talk!( reporters clamoring) Guys, guys, it was a tennis ball, not a cruise missile. Yeah, those are gonna be coming from Brazil. And we are done here. My point is you deserve a chance to be a girl. Go to parties. Mess up a little. And what if I did? What if one time I actually let loose and made a mistake? It would be healthy. No, no, I don't think so. I do. I'm pregnant. It's okay. You're gonna be okay. No. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm seeing things. I'm hearing things. I'm talking to you about my feelings, which I never do.- MAN: There she is.- You know what? I'm glad my dad smashed a ball into this guy's sternum. Even if it ruined everything. Because De Soto, he's a bully. Skip is right. He's got us over a barrel like a bunch of Ecuadorians. Hey. Us, too. He's been leaving me the worst voicemails. But you've taken enough harassment from this guy. His moustache is so effortless. He's threatened your economies, turned you against each other. He stole Miguel's mistress. I still love her. Miguel still loves her. But now you can stand up to him. This... is a day of destiny. Hmm? Uh, do you understand? How do you say that? Comprende? I have the votes. Your trade deal will crumble like your nation's aging infrastructure. Guy's got a million of those.( man clears throat) Mr. President, we are ready to vote. All in favor. How did this happen? You divided us. Skip united us. And that just had a better feel to it.( men laughing, cheering) Dad, I'm sorry I'm in your seat again... No, it's okay. Stay. DALE: We give in to pride. We hold on to resentment. And sometimes, Oh, yeah... oop... Nice, nice. Dad, I have to tell you something. This was a great idea. We needed to get out of the house. So, why'd you give your brother such a hard time about that Jessica girl? I'm sorry, I just, I never had feelings like this before. Oh, you have a crush, too. Well, you're 13. That's a good thing. So, what's his name? Jessica. Skip, you need to know, when you want Gilchrists to make a bunch of embarrassing mistakes, we'd like to vote for'em first. Okay, thank you very much. Oh, and, oh, and the president, please, can someone tell him that Brazil is an ally? On the bright side now, the Pentagon has lined up a badminton game between President Gilchrist and the ayatollah... I'd pummel his ass, too.

{"title": "Axe Cop Zombie Island... In Space", "content": "- There he is!- What are you doing?- Where are you taking me? I had a feeling you were behind all this. Of course you did, Chemist M. You are the smartest man in the world. Yes, I am. But whatever you want from me, forget it.- I'll never help you!- Don't help me. Help her!- Daddy! Isabella! No! Now, Chemist M, You are going to build me an evil army... An evil unstoppable army... An evil unstoppable army... of zombies! On zombie island I will chop your heads off! I understand we returned it late, but can you just waive the late fee this time?- I'm not saying it's your fault, ma'am.- I am not raising my voice. I'm trying to talk over you- Because you won't stop talking! Axe Cop, can you get that? Axe Cop, what are you doing? I'm imagining myself with different hair and mustache styles.- I'll have to call you back. Oh, hi. Uh, can I help you? Are you the one they call Axe Cop? No, I am. What's wrong with your voice? Nothing. Everyone from London, England, has to talk like this. My name is Isabella M. My father was... Chemist M, the smartest man in the world. He was kidnapped by Nazis and no one, not even me, knows where they took him.- It's a mystery.- Was a mystery. I recently uncovered these lost Nazi files. Your father is on zombie island in space? And even if there is... only the slightest chance he's still alive, I have to know for sure. Axe Cop, will you help me? Only if you tell me... how you think I'd look with a mohawk and a handlebar mustache? Hmmm. Honestly, I think you'd look better with crazy pizza hair and a super curly beard and mustache- with a robot ghost inside.- That is correct. Wexter!- Let's go. How much longer? 10 minutes. 15 at the most. Wrong. We're here.- What was that?- Oh, thank you.- I'm married.- What the heck? A jet- pack- wearing zombie!? I'll chop your head off! I love killing zombies. Something's weird. Zombies always fight me till I chop off their heads.- Come back here, zombies! We're not safe here. Let's hide in that dark cave. Oh my goodness, it's father's laboratory! This is father's laboratory! It's just like the laboratory he had back at home. Look at this! Now I'm no videologist, but maybe this VHS tape can tell us- what happened to your father.- Oh, ripping! That's my daddy on the telly... Which is what we call a television in London, England. It's day 28. Even though Adolf Hitler sent me here from London, England, To create an evil zombie army, I have been working on a cure. A secret potion that will turn zombies good. My secret potion is almost complete.- All it needs is a bit of cinnamon.- Oh, bloody heck! No no no no!- No- ooo!- Oh no! No... Oh daddy. A bad guy must be controlling them... A really smart bad guy. Attention, zombies. Thanks to you, my zombie robot is finally ready for launch!- What?- We have good news and bad news! The good news: Chemist M was working on a potion- to turn zombies into good guys.- Let me guess- No, let me just tel...- The bad news is his brain Was eaten by a zombie before he finished it. Well yeah. How did you know? Because the zombie who ate the world's smartest brain Took the world's smartest poop. That's impossible. Zombies don't poop. Tell to Mr. Doo Doo. That's Dr. Doo Doo to you, Axe Cop. I've come too far to have you stop me From completing my plan, which is to go to London, England, Marry the queen and use her scepter To take over the world. Zombies, get him! Cheerio! We need to go,. Dr. Doo doo is flying to London, England. London, England? But why? Because that's where poop gets its power.- Let's go!- No. I'm staying. Your father's brain was eaten. He's a zombie now.- There's nothing more you can do.- Yes, there is. I can finish my father's work. I can create a potion that will turn zombies good, Then I can find my zombie father, Let him eat my brains so I can turn into a zombie too, And then I will pour the potion onto both of us And turn us both into good zombies.- That's a gross plan.- Isabella, are you sure? I've been without my father my whole life And this is the only way I can be reunited with him. Now go to London, England, where I am from and save the world! Seriously, I'm married. How dare you, zombie robot?! I am The Queen of London, England! And I am Dr. Doo Doo, Your new husband.- Do you, The Queen of London, England,- I do.

{"title": "Longmire Bad Medicine", "content": "Previously on Longmire. Ed Gorski is stalking me. Broke into my car. My house. There's no greater enemy, than the mortal enemy of a friend. I lifted a fingerprint of the car. Cady was driving. I did find an interesting detail. You've found that David works for me. Would you mind telling me why you were in Denver? He's expecting to speak with me, the slightest contradiction in our stories and he will notice. Ma'am. Cady: [ Chuckles ] [ Telephone rings ] [ Laughs ] [ Telephone beeps ] Longmire residence. Ferg: Cady? Morning, Ferg. What's up? I didn't expect you to be there. Uh, how are you... how are you going? A- are you feeling any better? I am. Thanks. Is the Sheriff around? Yeah. Dad! It's Ferg! Hold on. We got a call because a guy was beaten up pretty badly last night, and, um... Walt, there's something a little... [ Sighs ] I don't know... delicate about this situation. What is it? Well, I guess this guy's been staying here for a while. And he's from Philadelphia. So... I was looking at his phone... Ferg, spit it out. He called the same number 30 times in the last few days. That number... Is Vic's. I'm sure you know that... Vic's marriage is a little... rocky. Don't jump to conclusions, Ferg. Well, I'm not, but I- if this is what it looks like and Vic is having an affair... you know, her husband found out, beats this guy up... I mean, she could be in some real trouble. Walt: What's the Victim's name? Ed Gorski. Sync and correction by GeirDM www. Addic7ed. com [ breathing heavily ] Ed: Hey... Sheriff. Come to finish the job? What did you get yourself into here, Ed? [ Chuckles ] You tell me, Sheriff. Well, it says here you got a busted rib, missing tooth, and you took a pretty good blow to the back of your head. You get a good look at your attacker, Ed? No, I didn't. You made sure of that when you snuck up behind me and hit me in the head. I didn't do this, Ed. Even though a few days ago, you said you would do exactly this if I didn't leave your county? Doesn't matter what I said or didn't say. I didn't do it. How long you been sleeping with Vic? [ Scoffs ] I'd think by now you'd learn to watch what you say. No. Now I got nothing to lose. The people of your county are gonna be surprised to discover that their Sheriff goes around beating up strangers. Well, I think the pain medication is clouding your mind, Ed. [ Door opens ] Vic: [ Sighs ] You wanted to see me? Ed Gorski was, um... Beaten to within an inch of his life last night. I can't say I'm sorry to hear that. Ruby: Got Sergeant Haynes, Highway Patrol. What's that all about? Vic, um... I need to know the precise nature of your relationship with Ed. Was he just an angry ex- cop who lost a partner, or is there... More to this situation? How is that any concern of yours? Because I am involved in this. No. This is my problem. And I will handle it. Yeah. Um... I kind of made it my problem. Um... A couple of nights ago, I went to see Ed, and I told him to leave town. One could characterize what I said as a threat. Now that the man's been beaten up, Ed thinks it was me. I never asked you to do that. I know. I know. Now, I need to know that this man was threatening you and not that you two had some kind of... romantic relationship. [ Clears throat ] There was... Kind of, sort of something between Ed and I years ago before I was even married.\" Kind of, sort of something\"? It lasted a few months, but he was married, so... I ended it. And then I met Sean. Look, Walt, I- I promise I never meant for you to get roped up in this. [ Sighs ] Just let me go talk to Ed. I think I can get him to drop the charges. How? Just trust me. [ Knock on door ] Walt... Mathias is on the phone, and... surprise, surprise... he's not happy. [ Police radio chatter ] He didn't want me to call his daddy. Why is my Deputy in the back of your vehicle, Mathias? Neighbor called in some suspicious activity. Saw Deputy Connally driving around the neighborhood, peeking in windows. It's a bit over the top to cuff him. Well, he didn't have permission to operate on the res. Oh. And he just started using these on the back door when I pulled up. May I have a few words with my Deputy... alone? You can have him, but not his car. I towed it. [ Sighs ] [ Keys jingle ] [ Handcuffs click ] He can retrieve it from impound later after he pays the fine. You know Mathias could've locked you up. What were you doing on the res without his permission? Come on, Walt. You sneak around behind his back all the time. That's true. I always feel bad about it. And I always have a good reason. What's your reason? The house I was looking into belongs to a guy named David Ridges. I'm pretty sure he was involved in causing Cady's car accident. I found proof that someone intentionally caused that flat tire that she was fixing. I also found David's fingerprints on the car. [ Engine revs ] [ Insects buzzing ] [ Breathes deeply ] Battery's dead. What the hell happened in here? Maybe this will tell us. [ ] [ ] [ Sighs ] That's quite a suicide note. Yeah. But what happened to the body? Should we call Mathias? Get him involved. Walt: And say what? That we snuck back onto the res, illegally broke into a house? With probable cause. We discovered a suicide, but we don't have a body. Also, there's no drag marks or any sign of blood on the floor. I don't know much about native American spirituality, but is that time- travel stuff normal, or a sign that the guy's a little nuts? Yep. I mean, where in the hell is he? He didn't just [ Scoffs ] disappear, did he? That's a good question, Branch. And who is he? [ Sighs ] Why was he trying to hurt my daughter? I've never seen this guy in my life. Yes, you have. I think I'd remember it. Apparently... He was pouring drinks for you the night before the election. I found this at Cady's house. This don't make any sense. There's one more detail about this guy that might factor in. David Ridges worked for Jacob Nighthorse. I think Nighthorse had David... Sabotage Cady's car to... Keep your voters away from the polls. Last week, I confronted Nighthorse about it. And Nighthorse denied it. Pretty much. [ Sighs ] You think Nighthorse told Ridges that you were onto him, Ridges killed himself? It occurred to me. It also occurred to me that... Nighthorse knew I was onto him, and he killed Ridges, and did a pretty convincing job of making it look like a suicide. [ Woman speaking indistinctly over P. A. System ] No flowers? I thought at least a balloon. Cut the shit, Ed. Language, Vicky. I might have to wash your mouth out with soap. Is that how you talk to your Sheriff boyfriend? He had nothing to do with this. He seems a little old for you, Vic. What's that about? Daddy issues? What do you want from me, Ed? I want you to feel the consequence of your actions. Isn't it enough that I had to leave town... Leave my family... The only home that I have ever known? [ Sighs ] You don't think that I felt those consequences? No, I don't. [ Scoffs ] I think you had a change of scenery. You haven't really felt what I've felt. You haven't had your whole life unravel. You've been out in big sky country with your chicken- shit husband without a thought in the world for the lives you've ruined. [ Grunts ] You want me to feel bad? I feel bad. [ Grunts ] I want you to feel what it's like to have everything you care about taken away. I want you to hurt, Vic. [ Sighs ] [ Sniffles ] I can arrange that. [ Sighs ] It all makes sense to me. He's calling on The Crazy Dogs, what the blackfoot call their dog soldiers. [ Sighs ] Again with the dog soldiers. Show me what else you found in his house. Yeah. This is negative medicine. It is used by someone who is on the dark side. It represents lost spirits that are desperately looking to find their way back to the light. I hope he finds the light after what he did to my goddaughter. He needs to go back. So [ Clears throat ] You believe he actually time- traveled? A lot of my people have a different idea about the nature of time than you. Perhaps he will return in a few months or years. You can ask him then. I don't have years. I need to know how this man is connected to Cady's accident. Well, if I were you, I would proceed with caution. All this... Bad medicine, whether you believe in it or not, tends to attract some dangerous types. Like Nighthorse. What does Jacob Nighthorse have to do with this? I'm not sure. I think we should go have a chat with him and find out. [ Sighs ] Hey, Walt, I need to talk to you. I can go alone. Okay, sure. But don't go in hot. Cool as a cucumber. So... [ Keys jingle ] What's up? Ed Gorski's gonna fill out a crime report, but he won't be naming you. [ Sighs ] So, who's Ed naming as his assailant? Me.' Cause I did it. I didn't want your life getting tangled up in this mess, so I decided, before he came after me, I was gonna go after him. You beat him up? Show me your hands. [ Sighs ] Based on the way Ed looked, I'd expect to see a cut or a bruise or... I didn't use my hands. I used a baseball bat. You didn't hire Hector? No. And Ed's gonna fill out a crime report based on what I told him, so I just thought you should know. And I should probably, uh... Put myself on suspension until the dust settles. Vic, if he files that report, you're not gonna be able to work here... anywhere, really. I guess I should have thought of that before. Branch: Got a few more questions about David Ridges. Why? David is dead. How do you know that? Because I found the body. When? Two days ago. I was worried about him. He started talking about... Killing himself. Though he never put it quite like that. He talk about going back in time? Yes, that's exactly how he put it. How did you know about the time- travel thing? Did you talk to David about the flat tire? No, I didn't. Hmm. You were the only one I talked to about that. Then I guess he'd heard about your suspicions through me. I don't think I'd be betraying him now by telling you that your suspicions were well- founded. Did he tell you something about it? He told me everything about it. He thought that by disabling that car Cady Longmire was driving, he'd be helping me... and, of course, you. He never meant for anybody to get hurt. So, he confessed to you and then killed himself. If all that's true, then where's the body? Hopefully with his ancestors. I'm gonna need you to be a little more specific. A little less spiritual, you mean? I burned it... As per David's wishes. Show me where. Hello, lawman. How'd you find me? Hector, I've got friends in the Cheyenne nation. You're not supposed to be on the res. You're not supposed to be off it. I go where the wind tells me. Justice has no borders. But you should know an injustice is about to occur. Must be Tuesday. Someone's about to go to jail for what you did to Ed Gorski. Who is Ed Gorski? The white guy from the motel. He's laid up in a hospital now with a missing tooth. Kind of your calling card, if I remember correctly. If you don't come back to the station with me, someone else is gonna confess to that beating. If she does, she'll likely lose her job. She should not confess if she did not do it. I know that. But she's going to. Now, an assault charge for you might mean a little jail time or a fine. It's not gonna ruin your life or end your career. Some might say it'd enhance your reputation. I do not care about my reputation. But you do care about right and wrong. [ Police radio chatter ] [ Knock on door ] Longmire residence? Cady: Yeah. Excuse me. Sorry, you can't just come in here like this. Detective Fales, what is going on here? Is your father at home? No. What is this? It's a search warrant. For what? Honestly, I don't really know. We're serving it on behalf of another police department. You think my dad had something to do with killing that meth head in Denver? What'd you do, standing bear? Nothing. Fales: If you really think about your father and how much he loved your mother, is it really so hard to believe he would want to kill the man that took her away? So when I came to Denver, you were already investigating my dad? You weren't helping me. You were just digging for information. Mathias: I'm gonna need you to close down. Fales: You almost done in there? Almost. Don't touch that. Don't! You can take anything you want, okay? It doesn't matter because my dad is not a killer, but you cannot take this! Open it. Go to hell. Cady, I have a warrant. Now open it. [ Crying ] She can... she can keep the tea box. [ Police radio chatter ] Officer: Don't forget the cabinets over there. Ruby: Those are very important documents. I'm gonna need those. Hey, who are you? What's going on? They showed up an hour ago with a search warrant. Why didn't you call me? He wouldn't let me use the radio. Who? Fales: Hello, Sheriff. Who's your friend? Ferg. Lock him up. Officer: See this one? Officer\u266a2: Yeah, I saw that. There should be a file cabinet over here. You mind telling me what's going on in here? I found a witness connecting you to the Miller Beck case. Who's Miller Beck? The man who stabbed your wife. Never knew his name. Not even when you attacked him in a meth house in Denver last year? You're tearing up my office on the word of a drug dealer? Oh, no, no, no. He told a very compelling story. This witness remembers being approached by a big cowboy that had all kinds of questions about Miller. The witness told the cowboy that Miller had showed up recently with$700 in cash he had taken off some lady in a purse- snatching. The cowboy asked him to describe the purse. Then, he paid the witness a few bucks and went on his way. Cowboy in Denver... what are the odds? Well, a few hours later, that same cowboy busted into their house with a gun. He attacked Miller, but Miller's friends were all cranked up on meth, and they kicked his ass. When I showed the witness some photos, he identified the cowboy... as you. That's quite a story... And one decidedly lacking in evidence. Why do you think I'm serving search warrants? Jacob: I brought David's body out here to honor him. And because a man tortured by as much dark medicine as David Ridges needed all the spiritual help he could get. I wanted to set him on the right path into the next world. You didn't think to call us? Or Mathias? Why? No crime was committed. Troubled young man took his own life. He has no family. No one wished him ill. Except you, I guess. I did not wish him ill. I was just trying to find out what his fingerprints were doing all around the flat tire that almost killed Cady Longmire. Obviously, I'll need more than your word to confirm that this is him. It was him. Then you don't mind if I take a sample for DNA. No. You will not. This might not look like much to you, but it's sacred ground. David is with The Crazy Dogs now, and you will let him be. I need to do my job. You set foot on this land again... The force of the Cheyenne nation will come down upon you for disturbing a holy place. Henry? Fales is here searching my office. I just wanted to warn you. Too late. [ Police radio chatter ] They are here. They gonna find anything? Nothing I cannot explain. So, what are you going to do? At the moment, there's not much I can do. Fales has pretty much taken over the office. Couldn't come at a worse time. I got, uh, someone in custody who doesn't need the extra scrutiny right now. Who? Hector. [ Sighs ] Walt, I told you about Vic hiring Hector so that if there was a beating, you would not arrest him. After all, he was doing something for your friend. Things have gotten more complicated. [ Police radio chatter ] You have no idea. [ Door opens ] [ Sighs ] Hey. [ Chuckling ] Hey. [ Kettle whistling ] What are you doing here? Get used to it. Yeah? What... what's that supposed to mean? It means that I might be out of a job soon. What? [ Clears throat ] There's, uh... [ Sighs ] Some stuff that's been going on that I haven't told you about. Uh- oh. That doesn't sound good. It's not great. [ Scoffs ] Do you, um... do you remember those flowers? Somebody from Philly showed up here in durant, and he's been... [ Sighs ] Threatening me. [ Groans ] This Bobby donolato thing. When are they gonna let this go? You didn't do anything wrong. Cops aren't supposed to rat on other cops. You know that. You did the right thing. They were breaking the law. Why didn't you tell me this was going on? [ Sighs ] Because I don't want to worry you. It wasn't Gorski, was it? [ Sighs ] Well, now I know why you didn't want to say anything. Where is he? I'm gonna kick his ass. Somebody already has. That's why I might be out of job. [ Cellphone ringing ] Well, answer it. Maybe it's another ex- boyfriend looking to get back in the game. Sean. Fales: You going somewhere? You got your job to do. I still got mine. I have to move this prisoner. Well, can't you find someone else to do that? I may still have a few questions to ask you. Ferg, let me borrow your cellphone. Uh, okay. You got any questions, you can give me a call. Hector: Where are you taking me? There's too much activity in my station. I'm friends with the Sheriff in Cumberland County. I think he'll take you in. You mean jail. For a little bit. You in some type of trouble, lawman? I don't know, Hector. Maybe. Then why don't you just keep driving? I can't. [ Horse whinnies ] What are you doing out here? Looking for you. Ruby said you two were on your way to Cumberland County. And the horse? It is for Hector. You are going to put him on it and tell him to disappear. Told you before, Henry... I can't just let him go. You can, and you will, because you owe him. I owe him? Never done anything for me. [ Sighs ] Actually, that is not entirely accurate. He killed a man for you. When I saw what happened to you in Denver last year... I realized that there were only two ways the situation was going to end... with you dead or with you in jail. Neither of those two seemed right to me. So, while you were recovering, I took the photograph and address out of your pocket, and I went back to Denver. [ Gasps ] It is time to get your spiritual affairs in order. What's going on here? Who are you? I am the judge and the jury, and I am here to pronounce your sentence. Are you ready to hear it? Get out of my way. [ Grunts ] Death... within the next 24 hours, you will die. Do you know why? Because you are a murderer, and you do not deserve to live. Think about that in the hours you have left. Walt: So, what does any of this have to do with Hector? I did what my people often do when your justice system fails. I called in Hector. You pronounced his sentence, and Hector went there and killed him? Yes. Hector: No. I told you before, lawman... I'm not a killer. Hector, you told me that you did it. You told me that man hurt the lawman's wife, so I hurt him. But I'm not a killer. Hector, someone broke his neck and buried him in a shallow grave. I believe you. But it wasn't me. I beat him like I've never beaten anyone, and I gave you his teeth, but I didn't kill him. If I did, he would have stopped feeling pain. Death is release. Pain is forever. [ Sighs ] I assumed that you killed him. I think choosing who lives and dies is up to the great spirit, not me. I'm just a man. [ Sighs ] So, what are you going to do now? Well, if he had killed that guy, I'd probably release him. But now,'cause of this Ed Gorski thing, I don't think I can. Ironic... Hector was the only one of us who did not have murder in his heart. So, if it wasn't you, and it wasn't him... who killed that meth head? Where'd you move Ed Gorski? He called me to come down. Excuse me? Ed Gorski. I was just in his room. He's not there. [ Sighs ] He checked himself out an hour ago. Shit. Are you Deputy Moretti? Yeah. Mr. Gorski left this for you. [ Woman speaking indistinctly over P. A. System ] [ Crying ] I'm sorry, dad. What for? [ Sniffles ] I didn't know that when I went to Denver I was helping Detective Fales. He tricked me, and I should have known better. It's okay, pumpkin. You didn't do anything wrong. [ Sniffles ] [ Sighs ] But I did. After your mother died... dad... Did you kill him? No. But I wanted to. And I tried to. Did Henry? No. So, what does Fales have that makes him think you did? A witness. Someone I talked to last year. A friend of the murderer. He told me that... The guy was bragging about mugging your mom. He even described your mom's purse, the one you picked out for her when you were 9. Remember that purse? Of course. Well, I went to the guy's house, and... That purse was in the garbage can. I still can't believe mom died for what she had in her purse. I mean, mom, of all people. You know, she always taught me,\" you put$50 in your purse and the rest...\"\" The rest in your boot.\"\"... ln your boot.\" [ Laughs ] Fales told me the guy that killed your mom got$700 out of her purse. Walt: Vic, what's up? I wanted to let you know that, uh, Ed Gorski left town. He's not gonna press any charges. That's good news. So, Ferg told me that you arrested Hector. You know, you didn't have to do that. You can't protect everybody, Walt. Well, it's sort of my job to try. [ Chuckles ] So, anyway, I guess I can come back to work now? You want me to drive over to Cumberland County, get Hector released? No, I'll take care of that. You've already had one heck of a week. Why don't you take, uh, a vacation day? Really? A vacation day. Paid? Don't make me rethink the offer. [ Cellphone beeps ] [ Sighs ] How'd it go with Nighthorse? He said he found David Ridge's body and burned it. You believe him? I'm heading out to the burial site now to see if I can get a DNA sample. You want to come? Where is it? It's on the res, right on the other side of the powder river. Might be better than going in there. I can't. I have to go in. I got called in to my own office. Fales: I was beginning to worry you weren't coming, thought maybe you were going to flee. Are you here to arrest me? [ Laughs ] I'm still thinking about it. Been wondering something about you, Detective. [ Door closes ] Fales: What's that? Why are you working so hard to find Miller Beck's killer... When your department could hardly be bothered to find my wife's killer? Town I grew up in was a small town, like this one. And our Sheriff was a lot like you. You don't know what I'm like. I do. You wear the hat and the badge. Far as you're concerned, you're the most important person for miles around. And you think you can do whatever you want without anyone checking on you. You know, I saw Sheriffs in the South who literally got away with murder. And I saw that corruption trickle down to the deputies. I grew up around too many badges who'd arrest a man they didn't like, beat a man who didn't respect them, kill a man who hurt them. I got my badge for a different purpose. I want to protect people from guys like you. So this is about you settling some old beef, with me standing in for some some corrupt Sheriff from where you grew up? I have motive and plenty of evidence. What would you do? Not ignore the one detail about this case that doesn't make any sense. And what's that? My wife's purse. My wife... Never carried more than$50 in her purse. Your witness said Miller Beck took$700 off her. If he didn't get that$700 from my wife, where did he get it? From another purse? No. I think someone paid Miller Beck to stab my wife. And I think the same person killed him to shut him up after I started asking questions. Who do you think would have wanted your wife dead? Someone that didn't like her, or someone that didn't like me. I got a few ideas. That's a very good theory, Walt, but I'd rather stick with my evidence. We turned up this medicine bag in your friend Henry's office. Mathias said his people often keep special items in those bags. I know what a medicine bag is. Do you know what was in Henry's? Teeth. And they match Miller Beck's dental records. I've got the dead man's teeth from your friend's office and proof that he was in Denver last year. You may be innocent, but your friend Henry is not. You arrested Henry? The tribal police did. Then I'll have him extradited to Denver. But don't you worry. I'll make sure he gets his one phone call. [ Shelf clatters ] Damn! Aaah! [ Telephone ringing ] Henry, is that you? Branch: Walt. Help me, Walt. [ Engine revving ] Who shot you? Who shot you, Branch? A dead man. Sync and correction by GeirDM www. Addic7ed.

{"title": "Nobunaga no Chef Episode #1.2", "content": "When I opened my eyes I was in the Warring States period. Why am I here? Who am I? I completely lost my memory. I do have memories of the peaceful period called Heisei. But what did I do there? Sometimes the image of a woman comes to mind. Who is she? I'll do it. The only things I do know is that my name is Ken... and that I have knowledge about cooking. That me, became the chef of Oda Nobunaga. Can I get out of the Warring States period and return to Heisei? Or else, do I have no other choice... than to live in this period as a cook? Come on! Warring States cuisine! That Tomonori... I'll make you regret... opposing this Nobunaga. What's that? Can you eat that? It's a truffle. Truffle...? Could you stop using those unknown words? You mumble a lot, it's tiring to be with you. Well, being with you soothes my heart. What are you saying?! Got it? I'll tell you only once again. I'm a man! Who are you! Rude fellow! I am the son of Sanza the Attacker, Mori Yoshinari... Mori Ranmaru! Mori Ranmaru... So he's the handsome boy who served Nobunaga... until the end during the Honnoji- incident? What?! Ranmaru! Father!- Don't enter on your own will. Excuse our impoliteness.- Not at all. Ken- dono, did you get used to living here? Well, somehow. And your memory? It's no good. I still can't remember. I see. There's no hurry. Come to me when you're troubled. Yes. Thank you very much. For some reason Oyakata- sama is really worked up about something today. Make him something delicious as to not ruin his mood even more. Yes. Well then, excuse me. Excuse me. Yoshinari- san is a humble person, isn't he? Speaking of Mori Yoshinaga, he's a spear expert celebrated for his valor. A brave military commander. For his own child to lose his live so young... he'd never expect that. But I know the history. Their future. Is it time to be worried about them? You should live long. Delicious. I can't see my past nor future. What do I do in this time? Ken, what's wrong? Ah, it's nothing. I want everything! Thank you! Buying these luxurious ingredients for that Ken... Ken might be a spy... from the West. He speaks as if he's protecting the Western barbarians. They don't eat human flesh. It's a lie. Indeed. There's a Western flavor to his food. If that's the case, what should I do to protect Oyakata- sama? On the occurrence that you catch that fellow by the tail... could you Hideyoshi- sama, ask Oyakata- sama... to reinstate this Inoue Kyonosuke as head of the kitchen, I beg you. I got it. Not sweet, a mellow scent. Is this black thing the true source of the smell? Yes, that's right. This dish is a soup with rhizopogon rubescens wrapped in crane meat. Rhizopogon rubescens? This. A fungus which grows on the root of a pine tree. In Europe... in the West... they're called truffles and are extremely valuable. The West again, huh? He must be a spy from the West after all. Sea bream with duck liver. Delicious. This also smells like Western stuff. What do you think, Saru? It's quite tasty. Ken is the head of the kitchen approved by Oyakata- sama after all. He's different from other cooks. Ken, I'm satisfied. Thank you. I'd like you to show your power at the battlefield too. Yoshinari, Saru. It's war. Go to Minami- ise. Attack Kitabatake. I'll make Tomonori realize my power. 1569, the 12th year of the Eiroku Era. For Nobunaga who almost possessed all of Kita- Ise... it was only Minami- Ise which was left after invading the Ise province. But Minami- Ise had a great force. The head of the Kitabatake family, Kitabatake Tomonori... even with an overwhelming difference in military force... wouldn't give in to Nobunaga. Yoshinari, take Ken with you as cook for your army. Mine? You and Ken get along. See whether Ken is of use in the war... or not. Your will. War? Me in the war? Going to the battlefield? Translation/ Sync: Super Saiyan Episode 2: The Heisei chef goes to the battlefield! Infiltrate the enemy's kitchen. What do you mean with wanting to go alone? I don't want Natsu- san or others to be in danger. What are you saying? Well, I am the head of the kitchen. Do you understand what the war is? Somehow... Hey, what does everyone at the battlefield want to eat? Is it time to say that? You might die when you go to the war you know?! I got it. And that's why I'm thinking about it. When you might die the next day... what is it that everyone would want to eat? I'll come with you. Don't. War isn't a place for women. I'm a man! What? This is an order from Nobunaga- sama. Make food before departure. But slices of abalone( uchi- awabi), dried chestnuts( kachiguri)... or kombu( kobu) using old- fashioned dishes are no good. Did you hear that woman? Uchi Kachi Yorokobu...( Note: This saying functions as talisman for victory) So I have to make food using ingredients other than the... essential departure ingredients? Listen to other people! Enough! Just do what you want! Natsu- san, wait! Idiot. I'll go alone. Yuzuke( hot water and rice) with salmon. Why salmon? Salmon return to the river where they were born. This is to make Nobunaga- sama return to here too. Not bad. Is what I'd like to say, but... what happens to salmon after they return? What happens? They die. No good. He's gonna kill me. That's right. Every living thing will die at one point. You have to support Yoshinari's army with your cooking. That's your job. Yes. Now departure. I've never eaten at a place where you don't know if you'll live or die. I only know that while living in a happy time... the most happy time is when eating delicious food. Who was that? Did she eat the food I made? Am I a cook from Heisei after all? Don't think about it. I have to do this now. I have to make the best dish with these hands. What's this thing on your back? It's a cauldron. I can see that by looking! The battlefield is a place where your life is at stake. A pan... I'm a cook. A pan is my weapon. What's the use of such a thing? Saru, Ken might become a burden to you. We have to defeat Kitabatake first to take over the country. Everyone. Gain success, gain fame. Oda Nobunaga commanded 50, 000 soldiers... and started the march to Minami- Ise. In response, Kitabatake Tomonori at Okawa castle gave directions to... raise an army of 16, 000 soldiers to ambush Oda's armies. That upstart mountain monkey! Ambush him! That Tomonori... Saru and Yoshinari, take down Asaka castle. I'll take down the Okawa castle where Tomonori is. Even though everyone's walking around wearing heavy things... no one complains. How strong is their endurance? Are you alright? Natsu- san? Why? I get to eat good food when I'm with you, right? I even came here. Don't tell me to go back. I won't. But don't do unreasonable things. Don't treat me as a woman. So that's Asaka castle, isn't it? Yes, the branch castle of Kitabatake. Kitabatake Tomonori, didn't show any response to reconciliation... and answered with a fight on life and death. Oyakata- sama got really angry. But... But? Kitabatake Tomonori is a person from a noble family who received the rank of middle counselor from... the Imperial Court. We shouldn't be able to advance without resistance. It would be good if there won't be any bad things. Bad things? Kitabatake Tomonori isn't going to give up. In that case, he has to go on starvation tactics. Which means that the women and children in the castles will starve. It's the weak people who suffer in the war. Yoshinari, you're a nice person aren't you? I did insufficient studying on history... so I never thought Oda Nobunaga had such a fine retainer. You say some strange things, don't you? Ah, I'm sorry. At least, let everyone eat some delicious things. Yes. Alright... Dried boiled rice, huh? In this period of 2 meals a day, it's a good place for malnutrition. It's not something that takes away tiredness. Natsu- san? Don't peek. I'm starting cooking, so I came to get some water. Help me out. How long have you been watching? Um, just a little while. A little while? You know, just a little. Idiot. It's boiling.- Thank you. Isn't that just fried rice? Well, look at it. Like this?- Yes. I'll put the fried rice in here. And then, the hot water. Natsu- san, please do it. What should I do?- Put it on the fried rice. There's something in the middle... Delicious! This is great! Instant yuzuke Warring States style. Give me some. Don't push. Delicious! What was in there? I used minced duck meat, radish, carrot and pieces mushroom to fry it. I put that in the rice and made a rice ball. When you fry a rice ball you can put a lot of things in it... and when you pour hot water on it you can eat a warm dish anywhere easily. I took instant food to the battlefield. With other words, a quick to make meal. I don't really get it, but... you're amazing. You made everyone this happy. He's a great man, Ken. What's up with this?! With Asaka castle in sight... why are you acting as fools?! Oyakata- sama has given you a great responsibility! Responsibility... Hideyoshi- san, if you'd like some... I don't need it! Mori- dono. I'm borrowing Ken. What is your intention? The Kitabatake army set up a camp further ahead. I'm gonna show... this fellow what a real war is. Oyakata- sama lend him to me. Be careful with him. I got it. Prepare to join my army. Japanese dock, dandelion. Saxifraga stolonifera. There's a lot of plants that can be eaten. As one would expect, this period is full of rich nature. Ken! What are you doing? Do you understand? The war is going to start from now. Brace yourself! Yes. Let's go. In- stant? Haha, how splendid. So our army's fighting strength was increased by food? As expected of my kitchen head Ken. Hideyoshi- sama took Ken- dono with him and went to the enemy line. Saru did?- Yes. He wanted to show Ken- dono what real war is. Saru and Ken, huh? Let's see what he got. Listen. We have to show those Kitabatake fellows what the power of Oda's army is. War... The real war has started, huh? Let's go! The enemy isn't there?! What happened? Watch out! Hideyoshi- san! Fool! What are you doing? Retreat!- Yes. I won't let you die here! Thank you, Natsu- san. You were of great help. Those guys! Hideyoshi- sama, don't overdo it...- It's no big deal! We have to attack!- But... Hideyoshi- san!- What?! Ah, hot! It's silver vine, a restorative. Do you always carry that with you? No, I plucked it a while ago. Don't pull the poisoned arrow out, it's better to disinfect it. This is good. Bamboo leafs? Sushi- ya's don't only wrap dumplings in bamboo leafs for display... they also have a disinfecting and anti- bacterial effect. Bac- teri- al ef- fect? Saying strange things again... You must be a spy from the West! Would he risk his life to protect the enemy? Ken, Natsu. I'll thank you for now. You saved me. Not at all. Alright! That Kitabatake... I'll teach him a lesson! Follow me! Ken- dono! Is Hideyoshi alright?- Yes. Okay, everyone! Follow Hideyoshi- dono! Oyakata- sama didn't put you in my... army to kill people. But there might still be people... who might run away or are wounded. You don't know what they'll do. Kill those who come to you. Kill them... me? Natsu- san? When the enemy comes, I'll kill them. Stay away! This is a Chinese wolfberry fruit, it might be of use when you eat it. I can't kill people. I...- Who are you? Somehow, save me! What are you going to do?- There's a kid too. I have to save them. This is war. This is no place for you. Especially not for women. You're a woman yourself, right?- I'm not a woman. Ken... So this is he Warring States period, huh? How long will this go on? Two days after departure, as vanguard for Oda's army... Hideyoshi's and Mori Yoshinari's armies attacked Asaka castle. The injured Hideyoshi also immediately returned to the front... and was said to fight incessantly like fire. Kinoshita Tokichiro Hideyoshi... has taken over Asaka castle! Saru, Yoshinari, good work on taking over Asaka castle. In the progress of the war, our army... was the best as if we had an overwhelming advantage. No, we had a hard time. We failed with the Okawa castle where Tomonori and his son Tomofusa are. They're holding the castle with 7000 soldiers in a resistance to the bitter end. They don't have a lot of provision, so I don't think it'll take long. If the war goes on any longer then there will be a lot of damage to our army. Reconciliation or general attack... When at a loss of what to do, to win them over might be the best thing to do. A half- hearted reconciliation doesn't have any meaning. Call Ken. Ken, use Yoshinari's army... to buy up the seafood in Ise. The seafood in Ise? I'll have you end the war. Me?- That's right. But... When you fail, I'll kill you. It'd be better if I won't have to. I got it. Lending the kitchen to them before the talks? Father. Are they planning on poisoning the food? Proposing peace, but killing. That wild and rude mountain monkey of a Nobunaga would do that. What is he planning? What do we do? It's alright. But if he's being suspicious then... kill that cook immediately. This is no good. The guys in the castle are on starvation tactics... so they haven't eaten anything here and are starving, right? It seems so. If we enter that place while carrying this... That's why I said I'd go alone. As if I'd let you go alone. See. Hello. It's food! Get them! These are ingredients for Kitabatake- sama's meal! Excuse me. As I thought, it's absurd. There's no way we're gonna get out of here safely. It's alright. Don't worry. I'm borrowing your kitchen. What is Nobunaga- sama making you do? Is it for the negotiations to go well? That's Nobunaga- sama's business. He should want to make the Kitabatake family surrender by all means. Surrender? That's impossible. They're guys who don't even give in after being on starvation tactics for this long. That's right. What is the thing that's driving their hearts? What is the absolute blow to end it? Kitabatake Tomonori is a person from a noble family who received the rank of middle counselor from... the Imperial Court. We shouldn't be able to advance without resistance. I'll show them the best dish. With this katana. Come on! Warring States cuisine! Well then, let me hear Oda Kazusanosuke- dono's idea. Even if we continue this useless war even more... there's nothing for both of us to win. What are you saying? I'll show you that we can hold out for even 5 years. What is he doing? I don't know. This war was one that Oda- dono... one- sidedly started in the first place. It would be best to withdraw. Think about this and answer. That answer will decide whether this Ise will be a peaceful place... or one with scorched earth where not even one plant remains. This man is just an upstart mountain monkey... who rose to power with just force. I won't lose from a guy like this with no accomplishments. I can't lose. I'm an influential person who even affects the Ashikaga shogun family... a cultured person. Dinner has been prepared. It's regrettable if you think it's poisoned. Kitabatake- dono, you can choose a dinner table for yourself. I don't think so. Bring it. Father. This is an arrangement of food I've never seen before. It's really pretty. The spiny lobster is from our sea. I'll eat plenty. What's this? I've never eaten such a sticky deliciousness. Father. This oyster... The faintly sour burned soup is still sweet. This garden eel and abalone are also very soft... It fits well with the sour dish. These are all delicacies I've never eaten before. What is this food? Ken, explain them. Yes, I will explain. First, the spiny lobster was cooked in miso mixed with mustard and has gold leaf. It's that sticky because of the animal fat. Animal fat? That animal fat melted and I saut\u00e9ed the shrimp. Saut\u00e9? Next is oyster gratin. Miso, eggs, vinegar, mayonnaise... I made a Western style soup, put it on the oyster and heated it. And a nigirizushi of fish from this season. So sushi is crucian carp or koi carp mixed with salt and rice... where you only eat the spoiled fish? That is narezushi. I obtained some very fresh fish today... and made it into nigirizushi. Nigiri... Saut\u00e9, nigiri... I don't know those words. Of course you don't know. The model for raw sushi was made in the latter half of the Edo period. So it's food from the far future. Head of the kitchen. You should look close at the food... this person made. Exactly what is this food? I don't know. What do you mean by that? I don't know. Cooking techniques are divided in baking, boiling and steaming, those three. But the food of this man... isn't one of any of those. Using fat, using flames... It's a cooking technique I've never even seen in the capital. It's as if he's using magic... to make this beautiful, brilliant, good flavored food. I heard Oda- sama has an acquaintance from the West. Maybe it's related to that... No, it's not wrong to call gratin Western style food, but... the way of cooking is from China- from the Ming. West, Ming... I don't know. I don't know anything. Maybe I even lose to Nobunaga... on the part of culture? The difference in army is obvious, if we fight even more... Tomonori- dono. I'd like you to accept my... second son Chasenmaru into the Kitabatake family. To win from this man I have... nothing. I comply with your reconciliation. I will hand over the Kitabatake family... inheritance to your second son Chasenmaru. We did it. Ken, look at that. Everyone's relieved. Ken's cooking saved everyone. It starts now. There's a long way after this. Spiny lobster, huh? That was quite good. Ken, are there still ingredients left? Yes. Go to the Grand Ise shrine tomorrow and cook there... and treat everyone as reward. Yes. Nobunaga visited the Grand shrine at Ise... and about the food boxes his subordinates provided... rumors spread that it was splendid... It is said that this was the model for... the lunch boxes people eat during cherry blossom viewing and other occasions. So spiny lobster is this delicious. I wonder if it's because Ken made it. What? You're cute like this, but... the Natsu- san I witnessed at the river was even more lovely. Lo- lovely, what are you saying?! It's true.- Don't say that! Next time you say it I'll beat you up. What is so funny about it? Enough. I'll just eat by myself. Natsu- san, I was just kidding! It seems that I'm intruding. Not at all. Nobunaga- sama, may I ask you something? What? Even though you don't believe in God or Buddha... why did you visit the Grand shrine at Ise? Do you want to know?- Yes. Because they're not my enemy. When God or Buddha are enemies then I'll kill them. Just like that. After this I'll go to the capital. You should come with me. Yes. Escape while you can. Serving Nobunaga- san will become more of a hell eventually. Hell... Natsu- san. He said we're going to the capital, your birthplace. Ken... What's wrong? It's nothing. The capital, huh? Sounds fun! I'll just eat this below. Delicious. I don't even know who I am. I don't know why I... time slipped and came to this period. Hurry up! But I can't die. I'll survive. Whatever happens, as Nobunaga's chef... in this Warring States period. [ Teriyaki brings the shogun to tears? ] I'll send you to the kitchen of the shogun.

{"title": "Jo Notre Dame", "content": "Mister Van Vliet, sir. I'm done. I put your dinner in the oven. That's for your daughters. Candies, from Istanbul. Thank you, sir. There's a payphone down the road, get me the number. Yes, sir. What temperature do you say it is, 75? Only in your pants, Normand. I'm freezing. I'd say 60 tops. What do I keep telling you? There's nothing like a good breakfast to warm you up. Well, as long as it's breakfast in bed with Roger Federer. I thought it was a drunk. This man wasn't moving. He was in my way. I went to poke him and then I saw the blood. I don't see your partner. Is that how we collect evidence now? Get that idiot off my crime scene! Another beautiful morning. OK, what do we think? Male, white, 45, 50 years old. Witness found him at 5. 15 am with no watch, no ID, no money... Bruises and lacerations over his body. Broken teeth, two were implants. Strangulation marks around his neck. Yeah, but there's no blood on the deck so he was probably killed somewhere else and dumped here. The killer took a big risk. Notre- Dame must have a special place in his heart. His eardrums might've been pierced. For what purpose? The Last Judgment. His head is facing the angel over there. He's waking up the dead to receive God's judgment. The killer pierced the victim's ears so he won't hear the trumpet. He won't get God's forgiveness. The killer is sending a message. This was payback. Just a thought. Angel found 43 separate bruises on the body. Broken fingers. Cause of death was strangulation by ligature- could be a rope or electrical cord. Looks like we're buying you lunch again. You were right about the eardrums. Sushi. Have you checked your mercury levels lately? The amount of fish you eat, you could get a job as a thermometer. We find out what he did to deserve this punishment, we'll find the guy who punished him. Look, Angel's traced the serial number on the dental implants to a Peter Van Vliet. 51, resident of Mol, Belgium. Near the Dutch border. That's a long way from home. A musician.\" Peter Van Vliet, master organist,\" has played the greatest cathedrals in Europe.\" Even played for the Pope. Have the police in Mol check his house. There's a number for his agent in Paris. God! I talked to him Friday. He was home rehearsing for a tour in Asia next month. He didn't say anything about coming to Paris. Did he have any enemies or stalkers? Peter had admirers. He held benefits for the orphans of Sudan, raised millions for children's music... Martine, check LeConte's availability. And get Sarina in Hong Kong. Is there a Mrs Van Vliet? Peter wasn't married. He lived alone. Sarina? Hey, hi. Yeah, listen, we have a problem with Peter Van Vliet. Yeah, he won't be available for the tour. But LeConte is available for... Pay attention. Well, what do you want me to tell you? Peter played religious music in churches. His fans were 30- year- old virgins and grandmothers. I want a list of everyone he knew in Paris. Friends. Colleagues. Blood- sucking agents. OK. Don't get me wrong. I had nothing but respect for Peter. He was a genius. Peter Van Vliet was an asshole. His agent told us you were friends. Well, that's pushing it. We had the same teachers, played the same churches... But you never played for the Pope. Van Vliet never let you forget it. Right. But people finally saw what a hypocrite he was. How do you mean? Well, his last concert in Chartres, six months ago, he showed up drunk or on drugs. It was a disaster, he played horribly, insulted the audience. The rest of his tour was cancelled. He hadn't played in France since. This never happened before? No. He never drank anything stronger than tea in public. He had everybody fooled. Well, he must've had his liver fooled too, because found no trace of chronic drug or alcohol use. And his tox report was clean. Thanks. I like your blouse. Is it silk? The only way you can really tell is by feeling it. Van Vliet wasn't a drinker or a user. No, I found pictures of him on tour and he looks sober, he's never got a glass in his hand. Who's the young man with him? No name. He's just listed as Van Vliet's\" protege.\" Yeah. Here he is with Van Vliet in Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse... But not in Reims or Chartres. No, I know. He just disappears halfway through the tour. Get a name and address on this protege. Everything OK? I gotta run. I am the Resurrection and the Life. Dear Lord, we commend to you today the soul of Helene. We ask in your mercy not to look at the woman she was, but at the woman she is becoming. May her soul, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Adele. I got a message. I didn't know your mother had been sick. Can we go somewhere for a coffee? I have to be back at the hospital in an hour. I'll drive you. I just have to stop at my place. I live four blocks away from here. OK. The hospital didn't give you the day off? I didn't ask for it. I need the money. Just be a minute. So, you like being a nurse? It's honest work. If you open the curtains you'll see better. Why'd you come to the funeral? To see you. You mind? Please, please. Can we get that coffee now? It fell off... It fell off the table. I saw your amphetamines in your bag. You searched my bag? Are you doping yourself? I'm not going to be interrogated like this. Not by you. Didn't you come up here just to get some pills? They're for my heart. What about the pills in the bathroom? Uppers, downers... This was a mistake. I thought after 12 years... Never mind. It doesn't matter. The Belgian cops said Mr Van Vliet's maid last saw him on Sunday at 7 pm. When she went back to work on Monday, she found the house broken into. And there was blood in the room where Mr Van Vliet rehearsed. So, kidnapped on Sunday night, beaten, killed and delivered to our doorstep by 5. 15 am. That's better than FedEx. The Belgians said that Mr Van Vliet's car was set on fire four months ago. Someone matching the description of his protege was seen running from the house. Yeah, that's right. Kid by the name of Guy Dore, 24, he lives off of Beaubourg. Let's get him. Jo, I can tell that you stopped for a sports drink. Just... I didn't dope him. I left the tour because Peter wouldn't let me play. He was intimidated by my talent. I told you, I'm a prodigy... No, you're a meth- head. You're a meth- head we caught with an 8- ball in his pocket. I know your dealer. And I know his dealer. They're all my friends. In two hours, I'll know every drug you scored in the last year including the drugs you slipped into Van Vliet's tea. OK. So I doped him with ketamine. I was really angry at him. But I didn't kill him. Why were you angry? It turns out you can't make a career out of being a child prodigy. Peter was supposed to help me get back on track. But he wasn't interested in helping me. He just wanted me to be his pimp. His pimp? Yeah. He'd see a woman in the audience, or at a reception, he'd have me give her his phone number or his room key. He used me. Tell me about his girlfriends. He was after women all the time, especially the married ones. The riskier the better. Screwing some woman while her husband's asleep in the next room, that excited him. But sometimes the husband woke up. Three months ago, Peter, he got some teeth implants because some guy caught him with his wife and busted his grill. Maybe busting Van Vliet's teeth wasn't satisfying enough. My husband had nothing to do with Peter's death. He spent the weekend rafting with the children. Anyway, we've moved on, we're negotiating a divorce. Can you think of anyone else who might've wanted to harm Mr Van Vliet? Peter never talked about his problems. When we were together, he was just focused on me. You saw him recently? Last month. He came to Paris every couple of weeks to see me. And others, I'm sure. I didn't care. Because he made you feel special... I hear he liked to take risks. You enjoyed that, you felt free around him? I suppose that's true. Can you give an example what he liked? I don't see what this... The more we know about him, the better the chances of finding the person who killed him. Peter was an exhibitionist. He liked to make love where we might be seen- in a car, or a restaurant washroom. Even here, late at night, he always insisted that we made love in front of a window. Different window or always the same? That one there. I didn't want to at first, but Peter had a way of overwhelming me. How many times in front of the window? Six, six or seven times. Somebody was there watching. Lot of customers sit at this table. The person would've insisted on sitting here late at night on these dates. We've only owned the cafe a few months, but this girl. A real space oddity. She'd order tea and then just sit here, looking out the window at the moon, listening to organ music on her earphones. Van Vliet was putting on a show for her. This space oddity- you get her name or number? Why would she give me her number? Because you asked her. Don't worry, we won't tell your girlfriend. Peter wanted me to watch. So the two of you were lovers? No, I never had sex with Peter. I admired him too much. You were a devoted fan. I took care of him. All that devotion, must've made you crazy to see him with another woman. No. Having me watch gave him pleasure. He was a devil, you know? And an angel. You went to his house in Belgium? No. I'm not a stalker. Is this a photo album of Peter? Yes. If you were a stalker and you'd gone to his house in Belgium, you'd have pictures of his house. But since you said you're not a stalker... There's just one that I got from Google. But that's all there is. I wasn't stalking him. What is this picture, here? That's the Jesuit school, on the Left Bank. Why do you have this picture? Seven years ago, Peter taught music there, just for a semester. Lucky them. They got to see the angel... and the devil. What do you mean? I knew a girl who was a student when Peter taught there. She said he had an affair with the mother of a student. A real religious lady. Peter totally seduced her and took her back to Belgium. It was a huge scandal. A religious woman... Motorcycle registered to Yannick Morin domiciled at 736 Rue de Belleville. No outstanding warrants. Give me his pedigree. Yannick Morin, birthdate 9th of February 1987. Two convictions, Assault 3, served one year, Possession with intent, served 18 months. Hey, what the... Wha... Hey! Hey, asswipe. Gimme back my stuff! Ug... Miss... Hi. I'm Jo St- Clair, I want to talk about Adele. I'm her father. I know. She told me. How do you know her? Her mother used to come here. This is a help centre for sex workers. You rescue prostitutes? No, they rescue themselves. After Adele's mother was diagnosed with cancer, Adele and I became very close. It was very brave of you to come to the funeral. Most men would've just run the other way. Adele has this boyfriend, a dope dealer. I'm no snitch, Mr St- Clair. Anything you want to know about Adele, ask her. She won't talk to me. Well, you'll have to work on that. And don't assume that she wants your protection. I never said that. Yeah, but you're a cop, aren't you? If you really want to be present in her life, you'll just have to find some other way. Maybe you can give me some ideas over a drink. I know a bistro around the corner... We can talk in my office... You only talk in an office? You're a shrink? I'm a nun. I don't go out for drinks at night with attractive men. The text I got... it was you. That was Adele's mother's idea, before she died. She left something for you. I have to get back to work. But good luck. Thank you, Sister... Karyn. Goodnight. It was a tragedy. A private tragedy. We just need the name of the parent Van Vliet had the affair with. It was between two consenting adults, it's not a police matter. Bayard, let's close off the street and set up in front of the gate. Close off the street? What for? A command post, so we can interview your teachers, parents when they pick up their kids... Her name was Pauline Langlois. Her daughter was in Van Vliet's music class. Mrs Langlois was the last person I would expect this from. A pious woman who lifted her skirt for her daughter's teacher. We terminated Van Vliet. What happened to Mrs Langlois? Van Vliet convinced her to move to Belgium. She took her daughter with her. So what about Mr Langlois? He was devastated, of course. He prayed hard for the return of his daughter. I don't know if his prayers were answered. You'll excuse me, gentlemen... Meet me in an hour at Notre- Dame. Read this. Thanks.\" In the 1600s, Father Antoine Estienne\" was executed in front of Notre- Dame for killing his illegitimate child.\" Estienne was broken on the wheel,\" but since he never admitted his guilt,\" he was denied absolution by the attending priest.\" He then burned in front of the portal of the Last Judgment...\" The Last Judgment. Two men tortured, two men denied forgiveness, two men left at the same place. Maybe one more coincidence. A dead child. The daughter of the woman Van Vliet took to Belgium with him. He killed her. If I was that girl's father, after praying to get my family back... I wouldn't wait for God's judgment either. I didn't see Mr Langlois on Monday. I went to Saint- Cloud. You like horse racing. I like betting. I couldn't care less about those stinking beasts. The last time you saw Langlois? Sunday morning? I didn't talk to him. I was late for mass. You know his wife, the one who divorced him? No. Mr Langlois moved in here six years ago, by himself. You can tell by the way he keeps house, he's still by himself. Did he ever talk about the man his wife married, or about his daughter? I think he said she died in some kind of accident. He has a son too. A son? That's a new one. Not much of a talker, is he? Not much at all. He reads a lot. Yeah, he sells books on the Internet, that's how he pays the rent. Oh, you didn't know? You call yourselves cops. Jo, he's a history buff. You OK? Don't worry about me, kid. I'll be around to get drunk at your funeral. What d'you got there? It's Langlois. He specialises in books on history and religion. So, he definitely would have known about Father Estienne and dumping Van Vliet at Notre- Dame, that's poetic justice. He just couldn't resist. We have an APB out on Langlois, and a unit sitting on his home. And his ex- wife? Well, we can't find her. She divorced him Mr Langlois, moved to Belgium, then fell off the radar. What about his kids? He'd be 17 now, the boy. The girl, Claire, there's no death certificate on file in France. Yeah, we're getting nowhere with our friends in Mol. You know, they must figure being a cop's a part- time job. Well, you need to get up there, show them how it's done. Where did you get that bruise on your neck? I don't remember. This two- bit dope dealer, Yannick Morin, was treated in hospital last night for a broken nose. He said he was mugged by someone who tried to steal his motorcycle. Odd thing is, he didn't file a police report. Well, a dope dealer... What's even more odd is you pulled his sheet last night. If you're running an investigation on Morin, I want to see a report. If it's something personal... I know what you're thinking. You're wrong. I know you're still using. Is this kid your dealer? Two years- isn't that what your doctor gave you if you don't quit your bad habits? It's just a shame you can't find some reason to stay alive. My bad habits are the reason I stay alive. So, the intruder came in here. Fingerprints? Shoeprints? We're waiting for Brussels to send a forensic expert. The rehearsal room's this way. Just through here. Oh, it's the other way. Old houses... We found blood here. Van Vliet's blood? We think so. We sent it to Brussels. Yeah, we think the killer surprised Van Vliet while he was playing, knocked him out. Found a picture of the happy family. We heard the daughter died in some kind of accident. Yeah. A year after they arrived here. The maid found her dead in the bedroom. About six years ago. Her bedroom? What kind of accident? The cause was cardiac arrest self- induced by Fainting Game Syndrome. The intentional cutting off of oxygen to the brain to induce euphoria. Apparently it's popular with the teenagers. What are you reading there? It's the autopsy. Your coroner, is he from Brussels too? No, from here. He's part- time. It says there was bruising on the girl's genitals. Did you investigate the cause of those bruises? Yeah, of course. The maid said that the week before, she'd surprised the girl at home with a boy. So, that explained it. It's just like I told the police. I found Miss Claire on the bed. The scarf was wrapped around her neck. The other end was tied to the headboard. Did you try to revive her? How? She was dead. Everyone understands Mr Van Vliet was your boss. But he's dead. You don't have to protect him anymore. If something happened to one of them..... wouldn't you want to know the truth? Doesn't Claire's mother deserve the truth? Mr Van Vliet called me into Claire's room. She had the scarf tied around her neck. Mr Van Vliet told me to call the police and tell them that I found her like this. And then he said to say that I saw a boy in her room the week before. Did he say what he did to her? No. But I knew. Her skirt was unzippered and I smelled alcohol. Claire's mother- did she suspect him? I think so. The next year, she went back to France with her son. Van Vliet told her to lie. It looks like he got the girl drunk and killed her, probably by accident, while playing a sex game with her. If we're going to prove a motive for Van Vliet's murder, we're gonna need a proper autopsy on the girl. It's too late. She was cremated. The ashes were sent to her mother in France two years ago. The mother, do you have her address? Hi, excuse me, we're looking for Mrs Langlois. Mrs Langlois? We'd like to talk to you please. It's OK. How did you find me? The police in Mol. We're investigating the murder of Peter Van Vliet. Are you OK? We know what he did to your daughter. We think that's why he was killed. My God! Yeah, his body was found at Notre- Dame. It's all my fault... If I hadn't fallen in love with that monster... I put Claire in the same house with him. You know who killed him? Maurice. It has to be my ex- husband Maurice. He was so angry, at all of us. Is that why you've been in hiding? Yes. I put my son with a cousin in Neuilly. Maurice and I had a terrible marriage. He was so controlling. I was always scared. That's why I went with Peter. Even now, Maurice is still trying to control me. He's tried to contact you? Yeah, this past week. He tried to call me, but I didn't answer. He left a message, he said he needed to talk to me. Do you want to help us catch him? Police! Don't move! Cut him off! Knock him down! Who the hell are you? That's my son! Don't hurt him! Alex! Langlois was hiding here. Search those woods! Send a unit to those houses. And call in a K- 9 unit. Alex... Alex, we want to go easy on you, but you have to tell us where he went. You think your dad cares about you? He should be sitting here, not you. No. My dad loves me. He loves us. He wanted to meet my mother, but... Why were you with him? He called me. He said that Peter was dead. Said he needed to stay with me. The people that I live with were away, so I said sure. And what else did he say about Peter? Peter was a bad guy. He killed my sister. He screwed up my family. So your dad gave him what he deserved- is that what you're saying? Your father is a hero. You can say it. Say it, Alex. My dad is a hero. I don't want to talk anymore. My son was very resentful after the divorce. But he finally settled down. He works at my cousin's gym. He's refusing to cooperate with my detectives. Maybe if you talked to him... It's no use. He loves his father. Sometimes he sees the world like a child. What do you mean? He still hopes Maurice and I'll get back together. It's impossible, of course. Maurice is too unforgiving. Alright, Mrs Langlois. We'll be in touch. Thank you. Drive her home, please. What are the chances you can talk this boy into giving up his dad? The mother has it right. He adores his father. Release him. Keep him under surveillance in case Langlois contacts him. How's our evidence stacking up? The lab's examining Mr Langlois' car for evidence that he transported Mr Van Vliet's body. As for finding Mr Langlois, we have a cell number- if his phone has GPS, then we can track him. Police! On the ground! Now! Easy, easy. Mr Langlois's no Jesse James. Jesse James would never let his son take a bullet for him. You haven't convicted me yet. No, but our experts are examining your car. It's only a matter of time before they find evidence Van Vliet's body was there. I've read so many detective stories. If I had killed and transported Van Vliet, don't you think I'd know not to leave evidence in my car? That's your story- I killed him but I'm too clever to leave any clues? I said, if I killed him. But you wanted to kill that cockroach... Yes, of course. He stole your wife. I can't put all the blame on him for that. If I'd been a better husband, a better father... You didn't love your kids? I loved Claire, I love Alexander, more than life itself. Van Vliet took them away from you. He took Claire away for ever. Yes. And I hated him for it. God said I shouldn't, but I did. And I thought of all the cruel things I could do to him. But I hate myself more for being careless with my family, for allowing this monster to destroy it. For not fighting harder to keep us together. Do you believe in the Last Judgment? I believe there'll be a settling of accounts. I believe you settle your own accounts. Do you know this book? There was a copy of it in your apartment. This passage describes the execution of Father Estienne. He was accused of killing his illegitimate child. He refused to admit his guilt. He was executed without receiving absolution from the church. Van Vliet was dumped in front of the Last Judgment. His ears were pierced so that he wouldn't hear the call to receive God's absolution. Van Vliet and Father Estienne. An inside joke by a history buff. My job is not to make yours easy. If you want to convict me, you'll have to work for it. I remember the day this was taken. I took her to school. There was a boy she liked, but he was ignoring her. She was crying in my arms. I told her a silly joke, and I made her laugh... No, there's nothing. There's nothing on the toll booth cameras. And then nothing in the car either. So, the guy's done his homework. He's playing with us. His rage- usually guys like this, once they kill, the rage is spent, gone. But not him. Watch out- little ears. Caleb helped make the mezze. Smells great. This is for you, Uncle Jo. Thank you. Look at those eyes. Huh? Look at them. As soon as he was born, I knew I was done for. Where are you gonna sit? Are you gonna sit here? Karyn, I need to see her. Excuse me, one second. I want you to set up a meeting. Fifteen minutes, anywhere. Adele's afraid of you. Her boyfriend was beaten up. He's a dope dealer, it happens. Jo, you know what, you can lie to me, but you won't get anywhere lying to her. I took his pills, the kid came after me. Look, I need her to give me a chance. You understand? This picture, I took this picture. You want her to meet you halfway? What are you putting on the table? What's your stake? Hey. I empty my head of every thought. I let go of every desire. I see my target. I concentrate. And... Yeah. Did you see that? Hey. You can come up. Get a meal and a bed. Yeah. That's it. Better a dog than a pet. Hey, somebody complained the belt on the number two treadmill was slipping. Hold on, hold on- I want to talk to you. I got a lot of work to do. We can talk while you work. I'd hate to think that I got up this early for nothing. So what do you want to talk about? Do I really have to tell you why I'm here? How much do you press? 220. Oh, 220. The van the cousin was driving, it's the one he uses for business, right? I guess, yeah. Excuse me. So, he keeps records of the mileage. What do you think he'll say if we find a 600 mile difference between his records and the odometer? Look outside. Outside. He took the family car for the weekend. He left the minivan with you. I know it wasn't your father. If he'd tried to sneak into Van Vliet's rehearsal room to surprise him, he would've turned the door handle the normal way. There would've been a noise, Van Vliet would've been alerted. Because the handle turns the other way. Van Vliet would've struggled with your father. But there was no struggle. Because the person who broke in knew which way to turn the handle. Because the person who kidnapped Van Vliet lived in that house for two years. I feel for you, kid. You just wanted your parents to be together. Like any kid does. But this tragedy was keeping them apart. This stinking wound that kept bleeding, your father couldn't forgive. You decided to do something about it. You killed Van Vliet as a message to your father, a message written in a language he understood, the language of history. You hoped it would heal that wound... and bring him back to your mother. I screwed it up. My dad found out what I did. But he said that he would take the blame. He said that he had to. He said that everybody would think that he did it anyway. I planned the whole thing, except... Except I didn't think... I never wanted to hurt my dad... No. No. Don't do it. No. No! No, let me go! I want to die! Why did you stop me? Too bad the kid isn't here to see that. Hello...

{"title": "The Glades Glade-iators!", "content": "Two keys are required to open your safe deposit box. The bank will keep one key. You will have the other. And if I lose mine? The box will have to be drilled open. The bank does not keep a spare or master key. Now, the vault contains privacy rooms. For maximum security, that is where we recommend you access your... huh? Most unusual. Oh, dear.- Hey.- Hi.- You're... here.- I here. Is Jeff ready? Uh, he didn't tell you. Didn't tell me... He already got a ride from Tina Honeycutt. Ah, Tina Honeycutt. One of the benefits of dating the older woman, huh? She can drive. I'm sorry. He was supposed to call you. No, no. I get it. No. Tina Honeycutt, pretty girl? No, I'm hardly at the top of his list, which means you can pick me up and take me to lunch for my troubles today. You know what? Actually, that might work. Dr. Hardy took a redeye to Madrid for a conference, so he's gonna be gone all week. Really? Yeah. I actually have to get that.- It might be the hospital.- Sure. Not the hospital?- It's Dr. Hardy.- From Madrid? Yeah. He wants me to make a house call. Wait. Do doctors still do that? This one does, apparently, except when he's out of the country, and then he sends me. Hmm. Patient lives in Miami, which means...- No lunch date.- No. And... Longworth. Got it. On my way. And I have to make a house call, too. Only my house is a bank. Diana Cabrera. 28. She works at the bank. The branch manager found her a few minutes after 9: 00 when he arrived to open the vault. Initial indication puts time of death between 8: 50 and 8: 55 A. M. this morning. That's very specific. What can I say? I'm good at what I do. And security footage shows her entering the vault at 8: 46, and she was found a few minutes later. Wait, we have the murder on tape? Why didn't you say so? My work here is done. Because we don't. This is a privacy area... The one place in the bank without cameras. That's probably not a coincidence. So, anything else that you want to take credit for? The victim has a subtle arching of the back called opisthotonos, suggesting a possible head trauma and cranial bleeding. I'll know more for sure when I get her on the table. She also had extensive bruising of the legs. Any idea what caused that? Not with both old and new bruises, but that's generally consistent with somebody with long- term abuse. You know if Diana was seeing anyone, like a boyfriend? Single, as far as I knew. At least no one that she spoke of. You know of any reason why she was in here before the bank opened, by herself? None whatsoever. Well, I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that she wanted something out of this safe- deposit box. That would require two keys... The bank key and a customer key. As in we're missing one key? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? Looking for this. What can I say? I'm good at what I do. Oh, hey, I- I'm sorry, but federal regulations require permission from the owner before you can open a safe- deposit box. An owner of a safe- deposit box that's dead... As in my victim? Then you'll need permission from the next of kin. Permission, judge, yeah, yeah. I got it. There's something the camera didn't catch. There's a bruising over the bridge of the nose. Which is an indication of what? Could be a possible death blow, but she could have also fallen. I mean, she was in a vault by herself with only one way in and one way out. Unless she was seeing someone on the sly and wanted to make an early withdrawal. Meaning what? Meaning that a healthy, attractive woman doesn't just walk into a vault and die of boredom, Carlos. Someone wanted her dead. And you can take that to the bank. Original Air Date July 1, 2013==sync, correction by== for www. addic7ed. com Well, turns out the safe- deposit box wasn't Diana's. It belongs to a person by the name of Bob Butler. Well, does Bob Butler know what Diana was doing with his\" maybe not so safe after all\" safe- deposit box? I don't know. I called and left word on the only number the bank has on him. Haven't heard back yet. Okay, well let me know when you hear something, as in getting permission for that safety- deposit box. Wow. This has got\" guilty\" written all over it. I mean, it kind of takes the fun out of it when you make it this easy. I'm sorry. You are? Curious as to why you're in a dead woman's drawers. Oh, I'm a loan officer here at the bank. Randy Dillard. And you're in her office because? I worked with Diana. She, uh, has some files I need for escrow closures. You guys figure out what happened yet? No, but I am getting warmer. You and Diana get along okay? I guess. I mean, we worked together. That it? Just all work, no play? Oh, yeah. Just work. Huh. Really? You recognize the sofa? Recognize the two half- naked people on that sofa? Ew. Yeah, I think you and Diana did more than just work together, huh? Okay, listen. Uh, the bank has a strict non- fraternization policy. I- I've gotten so used to lying about our relationship... Oh. Please, I don't want to lose my job.- Oh, okay.- I'm sorry. I should've told you the truth. All right, well, I'll forgive that lie if you answer this next question honestly. Who threw the first punch? You or Diana? Excuse me? The bruise on your cheek... Looks like a nice right hook. Yeah. I mean, what happened? Did she get sick of being abused, fought back? What? Oh, I would never hit a woman. I fell in the shower. You fell in the... It's not even a good lie. But I guess it's better than admitting that you beat up your girlfriend on a regular basis. I swear, I have no idea what you're talking about. I never laid a hand on her.- Is that Diana?- Yeah. She had sort of an interesting life outside the bank. By day, she was a bank vice president,- but by night, she was...- The Termi- gator... Star jammer for the Glade- iators! A roller- derby team? She scored 196 points in 38 jams this season. That's an average of 5. 158 points per jam. No one else even comes close. He's been like this ever since I showed him the tattoo. Wait, there's a tattoo? You're holding out on me? Just waiting my turn. Found it on the victim's back just below her neck. Daniel recognized it right away. It's not hard to get excited if you follow the team. As you can see on this video, which I pulled from the Glade- iator website... There she is breaking away from the pack. The Glade- iators score a point every time she laps a girl on the other team. So, why do they call her a jam... So, is it always that rough? I know. Awesome, right? That would certainly explain the bruising that we found on her body. As for the head injury, I can't tell to what extent it contributed to the cause of death without a full work- up, but she definitely suffered a concussion. And since the accompanying facial bruising hadn't turned blue, I know it happened sometime within the last 48 hours. So, did the Glade- iators have a match in the last two days? They're called bouts. And, no. Their last bout was a week ago. Well, could she have had a delayed reaction from an injury she sustained a week ago? I still need to drill the skull to see if there was subdural hematoma. But it's highly unlikely that she could've functioned at work or driven a car unimpaired with the injuries that I'm seeing. Well, then, I'm gonna need a Glade- iators full team roster. Looks like someone on the team wanted to terminate the Termi- gator. Push it back. Hey. Hope you didn't have trouble finding the place. Darius Locke. You must be a basketball fan. Uh, actually, I got your name from a text from Dr. Hardy, but my son's a huge fan, if that helps. Never hate to hear that. Miss? Uh, it's just Callie. Callie, yeah. We can do this over there. Okay. Scottie. Come on, take the press off, scottie. Let her breathe. You know, Dr. Hardy texted me and said that you were experiencing severe back discomfort and that you needed a consultation for a cortisone injection, but you don't seem to be presenting from your gait. Well, you haven't seen me roll out of bed in the morning... Literally. Takes me 45 minutes under a hot shower before I can even straighten up. And I'm sure that Dr. Hardy has told you that a cortisone injection isn't like taking ibuprofen. Oh, no, yeah. Of course. Chapter and verse. Trust me, I know the deal. I wouldn't have reached out to Hardy if I thought I had an option. Then you should also know that we should be doing this in the office. Oh. Sorry. Would you feel more comfortable if I left this open? No. I've seen a man's ass before. It's just, I mean, we should do this in the office so that I could use fluoroscopy and actually see an optimal spot for the injection site. Well, seems like an unnecessary trip to the hospital. Dr. Hardy was fine doing it right here. Yeah, well, I'm not Dr. Hardy. Girl, you are definitely not Dr. Hardy. Okay, look. Five years ago, Dr. Hardy saved my career with a spinal fusion, all right? So, I literally trust the man with my life. And if he has enough confidence to send you to do his house call, who am I to question his judgment? Here you go. That's a really nice ring. Thank you. Husband's a lucky guy. Yeah, it's my fianc\u00e9, actually, and we're both pretty lucky. When was your last cortisone shot? I don't know. A year, a year and a half ago, maybe. Why? Well, you're blood pressure's a little high, and sometimes that's a symptom of too much cortisol in your system. Well, it's never too high when Dr. Hardy takes it. Look, Dr. Hardy laid it all out for me. No more than three injections a year, nine in a lifetime, so, trust me, I'm not gonna mess with my health. Good. you can drop your pants. Uh, sorry. Closed practice. Well, lucky for me, I have a pass. Is your coach around? No, she's not. She's late, and unless you have a warrant, it's still a closed practice. Let me guess... your coach is one of the players, as well? The Termi- gator? That's right. Okay, and that would make you, uh... Josie\" The Cuban Missile\" Cruz? Okay. Well, uh, Miss Missile, I'm sorry to inform you, but, uh, your coach and fellow Glade- iator, Diana Cabrera, she's not late. She's dead. What? Diana's dead?- Mm- hmm.- What happened? Well, that's what I'm here to find out. When was the last time you saw her? Last night at practice. She have a fight with anyone? Anyone on the team she doesn't get along with? No. That's not how we do things around here. We fight our opponents, not each other. The Glade- iators are like family that way, and family always comes first. Huh. Well, that may be, but, uh, if your little family here is anything like mine, then, well, there's always someone that doesn't play nice. Test, test. Sorry to, uh, interrupt your practice. Everyone? Hi. But, uh, I have some sad news. Want to gather around? Diana Cabrera, your coach, your, uh, star jammer, and Termi- gator, was found dead this morning. Now, I'm... I'm pretty sure that words can't express what we're all feeling right now, so let's just take a moment of silence for Diana, our Termi- gator. Beach on Wheels, huh? Oh, moment of silence over. You really hate Diana that much? Uh, um... look, I... I didn't mean any disrespect. It's, uh, it's my knee. Locks up if I don't keep moving. In case you haven't noticed, I'm an old lady in roller- derby years. The... body takes a beating. Well, I noticed, other than walking out on a moment of silence for my murder victim, you don't really seem like a Beach on Wheels. I guess you'll have to ask my kids what they have to say about that. You know, some girls, they pick their names because they think it fits them, and some, like me, we just like to have a fun alter ego. What about Diana? Did\" Termi- gator\" fit her? To an f'ing\" T\" and then some. Okay, that was a little beachy. I'm just being honest. You know, Diana, she was our star jammer for a reason. I don't even know how we're gonna beat the Her- icanes in this upcoming championship bout without her. Oh, I'm sure someone will step up to the plate. Maybe you. Oh. I don't think so. No. My glory days are over, detective. I'm just in it for the fun now. Oh, yeah. That bum knee looks like a riot, all right. And what about Diana? Was she in it for the fun? Well, if by\" fun,\" you mean taking out anyone who gets in her way, sure. Yep. That beachy thing definitely coming through now. Detective, it's no big secret that Diana was a hard- ass. You know, it worked for her, and the team benefited from it. But if you think for one second that anyone on this team had anything to do with her murder, you better think about that first. I, um, I got to pick my kids up from the sitter. Am I free to go? For now. Daniel, what's up? Wow. Diana really the Termi- gator. Where'd you find this? There are multiple videos all over YouTube. I edited the best of them together. I was under the impression derby girls fought all the time. Why's this one so special? Diana's not fighting with someone on the other team. She's beating the crap out of her own teammate. Huh. The Cuban Missile. Josie Cruz. So much for family. Wait, freeze that. That ref... It's Diana's boyfriend from the bank, Randy Dillard. A. K. A. Arthur Ref- erelli. Go again. Oh, that looks like trouble in paradise. Looks like Randy Dillard, A. K. A. Arthur Ref- erelli, has found himself a new girlfriend, which means we got ourselves a Cuban missile crisis. Butt tattoo. Classy. Ah, Dee Dee is one lucky girl. But the whole point of this tattoo is to say\" Hasta la Vista\" to sweet ol' Dee by covering it up. And you need to wait outside. Oh, no. I'm good, actually. Oh, but it does make me wonder whose name is on Randy\" Arthur Ref- erelli's\" ass, Josie. Diana's or yours? And why you failed to mention that Diana tried to termigate you for stealing her banker boyfriend. Oh, wait. I know.' Cause then I might think you killed her. Okay. Put some of this on. It'll keep the tattoo moist until I get back. So, tattoo business is booming, huh? Who would've thought doodling on someone's ass could be so recession- proof. Obviously, the point of my art escapes you. Oh, your... art. To me, tattoos tell the story of who we are. Each one is a snapshot of a time in our life. Some people, like that guy in there, they want to cover up their mistakes. I don't believe in that. My story, mistakes and all, is right here for everyone to see. Oh, so\" Glade- iators,\" front and center. Someone you knew? My kid sister. Who, sadly, we lost six years ago. It's a reminder to hold the people we love close,' cause you never know when you could lose them. Speaking of people we love,\" R. D.\" Randy Dillard. Wow, not only do you steal Diana's boyfriend, but then you stick a tat on there to shove it in her face? No wonder she came out throwing punches. I didn't steal Randy, detective. He dumped that crazy, controlling bitch. Diana was a poser and a hypocrite, okay? She pretended to be one of us when she skated, but then she'd climb into her Mercedes, drive back to her fancy condo, and act all superior. She treated Randy like crap, and it killed me to see how miserable she made him. So you killed her because Randy couldn't fight his own battles? No. Diana was jealous. We fought, but that was it. End of story. Hmm. For now. But I'm guessing that your story's not that finished yet. And you might want to save a little space for a bit of jailhouse ink. Daniel, look into something for me. It's good news. Diana Cabrera did not die from a subdural hematoma. There was no blood in her skull. How is that good news? It's good news because with that ruled out, I looked at other causes of opisthotonos. Oh, that arch- back thingy? Yeah. It turns out opisthotonos, the arch- back thingy, is also a sign of poisoning... Strychnine poisoning, to be exact. Rat poison? That's one of its uses. I'm having her blood tested for it right now. I should also be able to tell you how the poison was delivered. I know it wasn't ingested or injected because there was no poison in her blood stream or stomach content. And I know it wasn't inhaled because there was no fluid in her lungs, which leaves only one conclusion. She rubbed it on. Would it kill you to let me finish? Sorry. It was absorbed through the skin. Ha! See? Yeah, and any girl on the team could have laced a jar of muscle balm with strychnine and put it in Diana's bag. Daniel. Any news on those bank personnel files? I checked with Director Manus, who's still waiting to hear back from the bank's corporate office. Is there anything special I should be looking for? Maybe. How would you describe Diana's roller- derby personality?- I'd say... ruthless.- Ruthless works. See if she was just as ruthless at the bank and then call me if you find something. You're really not gonna eat the last bite of that, are you? Wow, this patient must've really pissed you off. I can't believe I just took his word for it. That's so not like me. Well, I think you're being a bit hard on yourself. I mean, he... whoever he is... Is the one that lied to you. It's Darius Locke. Miami Storm Darius Locke? He said he's had one cortisone shot in the past year, which wasn't true. He's had two in the last 12 months from his team doctor, according to Hardy's files, and then the one I gave him.- Maybe he just forgot.- He didn't just forget. He's just another over- indulged pituitary case who thinks that life is one endless rap video.- Well...- And you know what? If he wants to play games with his health, that's on him. But then, when he's all like,\" Hey, girl,\" and then wants to lie to me, and then get me to do something that's against my ethics, that's when he can kiss my ass. All right, well, what does Dr. Hardy say about it? I haven't told him. Dr. Hardy's really clear about me solving my own problems, which I'm going to do, starting with talking to Darius' team doctor.- Oh.- Yeah,\" oh.\" I don't give a shit if they bench him or not. At least whatever he's doing to destroy himself won't be on my head. Sorry. Uh, yeah, Colleen. According to corporate, Randy Dillard has worked at the bank for five years. His ex- girlfriend, Diana, started just about two years ago. They were both loan officers. Equal title, equal pay. But not for long. Six months ago, Diana got promoted to vice president. Let me guess... a position that Randy wanted? And had been in line for since the beginning of last year. So, now he's working for his Termi- gator girlfriend. Yeah, and I'm thinking not too happy about it. Yeah. That's one reason to dump her, or kill her. That's not why I dumped her. Really? You worked at the bank for five years, Diana works there for a minute and a half, snatches the job right from underneath you, and you're okay with that? I was disappointed. I'm not gonna lie. But she obviously beat me out of the promotion fair and square. Beat something out of someone, from the looks of her game reel, and then you had to work underneath her, both figuratively and literally. I told you, detective, I dumped Diana out of personal reasons. It had nothing to do with work. Okay, so you're okay with these job reviews that she gave you? Diana's criticism of my work was, for the most part, helpful.\" Randy Dillard continues to show no initiative.\"\" Mr. Dillard once again demonstrated poor judgment regarding loan applicants.\" Oh, and this one, dated the night before she died... My personal favorite.\" Mr. Dillard's performance raises serious issues\" of ethical misconduct and could prove disastrous to this branch's financial outlook.\" Obviously, she was reacting out of jealousy because I was with Josie. Well, these evaluations could kill a career, Randy. Not just at your bank, but any bank that calls for a reference. But Arthur Ref- erelli... Huh. The derby was the one place where were in charge, right? I mean, Diana could push Randy Dillard around the office as much as she wanted, but she couldn't push Arthur Ref- erelli around the track. And while Randy Dillard didn't have the balls to stand up to Diana Cabrera, well, Arthur Ref- erelli had them to spare, huh? And it was Arthur Ref- erelli that killed Diana, wasn't it? You need to see this. Seems our victim, Diana Cabrera, was involved in a very nasty civil lawsuit... A lawsuit that did not turn out well for the plaintiff. Which would've left even nastier unfinished business between them. Aah! Oh!- Are you okay?- Leave me alone. Hey. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I don't need anyone's help. Maybe not, Beach. But if you killed Diana, like I think you did, then you're gonna need plenty of help from a damn good lawyer. I've already told you, detective, I had no reason to kill Diana. Even though you blame her for busting your knee and ruining your life? As in the million- dollar personal- injury lawsuit that you sought against her? You know, the one that was thrown out of court, leaving you broke, humiliated, and, I'm guessing, angry enough to kill? Tears? Really? I thought derby girls were tough. I'm sick and tired of everything going wrong, is all. I'm not ashamed that I filed that lawsuit, detective. I deserved that money. Diana ruined my life. I've got a torn meniscus I can't even afford to repair, and it's her fault. Her fault? You willingly participate in a dangerous sport. You signed waivers indemnifying, what, the team, the league, the arena? It sounds more like it's fault. Diana did this to me on purpose. She took me down with a blind block. She wanted to hurt me. Now, shouldn't she have to pay for that? It kind of looks like she did. That's not what I meant. I- I didn't want her dead. And yet she is. Why would she want to hurt you? I don't know? Because I wouldn't quit the Glade- iators? She said I was too old and too nice and too slow. She thought I was keeping the team from winning. Were you? According to Diana, I was. The sport wasn't just about winning for me. I've got two kids, parents that live with me, and I have to take care of them all. Sometimes I just want a place, you know, that I can go... I can just blow off some steam, have a little bit of fun. Nothing like a little cold- blooded murder to take the edge off. I'm not a violent person, detective. I didn't kill Diana. Okay, you... You got to believe me. Well, you'd think with all those tears I would, but sorry. I mean, not completely, anyway. So... Don't go skating off anywhere. All right. Blood work's back from our lab. I can confirm cause of death as asphyxiation due to strychnine poisoning. And the muscle balm from Diana's bag? The poison was definitely delivered through her skin in a highly concentrated dosage, but it did not come from that balm. Which means we don't have the murder weapon yet.- Daniel.- Yes? I need you to go back through Diana's car, office, and home. Collect every balm, moisturizer, liniment, ointment you can find. On it. Oh, and, uh, I'm gonna need you to go back through Diana's financials. Anything in particular you want me to look for? Well, you don't sue someone for$1 million if you don't think they have something of value. Oh, and where are we on the safe- deposit- box mystery? Three tries to Bob Butler with no response, so I put a call in to my judge friend. As soon as he issues a warrant, you can drill it open. Good. Keep me posted. Mm- hmm. We need to talk. Hey, girl. I got this, coach. What is this? Some kind of follow- up? I just tried to talk to your team doctor about your treatment, and guess what. He wouldn't talk to me. Specifically, wouldn't talk to because you specifically asked him not to. Okay, Callie, look. I got to be careful what's out there about me, okay? So, I'm sorry. Try not to take it personally. Oh, I'm not taking it personally. I'm taking it professionally... very professionally, because my patient, you, lied to me about the number of cortisone injections you've had in the last 18 months, which is not only stupid, it's all kinds of dangerous. Do I look like someone that's in danger? No. Darius, you look fantastic. This is a consent form I need you to sign so I can talk to your doctor.- Okay, I won't be doing that.- Why, Darius? Is there something you're trying to hide? Okay, Callie, look, I feel fine. Honestly. Okay, thank you. You keep telling yourself that. But one day... and it's gonna come sooner than you think... Your body's gonna say,\" Enough.\" It'll hurt when you stand, it'll hurt when you sleep, it'll hurt when someone tries to hug you. Is that how you want to live the rest of your life? Well, seeing that it is the rest of life, I guess I can decide that for myself. Sign it. Uh, detective. I looked into Diana's financials like you asked. I don't mean to speak ill of the dead, but for a banker, she wasn't very smart with her money. How so? Most of her money was tied up in real estate, which is not very diverse, particularly in this economy. Commercial, for the most part. She scooped up a strip mall in a short sale last year. I also found an eviction notice that she sent out to one of her tenants. I know this address. That's where Josie\" Cuban Missile\" Cruz has her tattoo parlor.- Thank you, Daniel.- But Josie won't be there. The championship bout's tomorrow night, and the Glade- iators sort of have this tradition.- A tradition?- Yeah. I like the sound of this. You coming? It's a sort of good- luck ritual. All the derby teams gather together and party the night before each bout. I can't even believe I'm here. Well, you are. Let's hope the Cuban Missile is. Oh, my God. D- d- do you know who that was? No, but it looks like you do. That was Queen Bitchtoria. Two seasons ago, she scored 127 points in a single bout. God save the queen. Over there... The Perm Whale. She plays for the Her- icanes. Yep. There she blows. There she is. Cuban Missile at 12: 00. Oh, my God. Okay, you got this one? Yeah. Wait. Y- you want me to take the Cuban Missile into custody? Absolutely. Good luck. Yo! Next time you send a boy to do a man's job, I might not be so nice. Oops. You coming? After you. You would've been mad enough to when you got handed this eviction notice. Right? She tried to kill your business, so you killed her instead. Look, you're a cop, okay? I know what this is. I didn't kill Diana, detective, and don't pretend you know me or my life. Really? Even when it's written all over your sleeves? You've got it all wrong. Diana encouraged me to open up my own shop. And when she bought that strip mall, she even gave me a sweet deal so I could make it happen. She gave me a chance when no one else would, and I was grateful. Okay, but that was before tattoo. I mean, when Randy dumped Diana, she became a crazy, controlling bitch... Your words... And tried to punish you with the eviction notice. No, Diana was gonna evict everyone. She had a plan.\" Gentrification,\" she called it. It wasn't personal. But you're the only person she gave this notice to, so, yeah, I'd call that personal. I was looking for a bigger shop anyway. Business was good. You said it yourself. Everyone was getting tattoos. Yeah. Everyone on the team got the same tattoo on their arm, except Diana. Why? She said it was because she worked at a bank and she didn't want it showing. That's why she only recently got one. But the truth was, like everything else in her life, Diana wanted to make a statement and come off all badass. How is that badass? Tattooing on top of bone across the spine is more painful than on muscle. Diana wanted to impress people. It was all for show. Are we done? For now. This is a photo of Josie's tattoo that I pulled from your phone, and this is Diana's. So, not only is Diana's tattoo bigger, but it's also mostly black. Not sure of its significance. I'm thinking Diana tried to rewrite her story, cover up a mistake from the past. Can you tell if there's a tattoo underneath this one? Forensic imaging, but that's gonna require a special infrared camera. It's gonna take a while, though. Well, then, you better get started. I'm hitting it... heading over to Tina's to study. Not too late. You tell Jim about these? Tell Jim about what? Darius sent over tickets to the next home game. Oh, no. Not just tickets... floor seats.- Floor seats?- Floor seats. As in... Floor seats! Boom! Yeah. Later, man. Whoo! That's why I didn't tell you. Really? That's the best you could do to help me out?- To help you out?- I had a hard enough time trying to explain to my 15- year- old son why I can't accept them, and now I have to explain it to my 38- year- old fianc\u00e9? No. You can't accept these? Jim, the tickets are a bribe. Right. Okay. How are they a bribe? He's doctor shopping for cortisone injections. I asked for a signed consent form for his team doctor, and he sends over floor seats. Right. O- okay. I can sort of see how you're thinking about that, but it's not a bribe if you don't act on it. Wait, no. You could look at this like a bribe, or look at it as, like, a really nice way of him saying thank you. Also known as a bribe. What would you do if a suspect tried to bribe you? Okay, totally different. How is this totally different? All right, how's this? It's not a bribe if Jeff goes, right? And I know you wouldn't want him to go completely unsupervised. Oh, my God. Wait, Cal. But they're floor seats. Nice. I thought I noticed a little perkiness in your skin tone. Uh, no, no. T- these all belonged to the victim. I know. Any of these my murder weapon? Dr. Sanchez tested them all. Not even a trace of poison. But I did find these. I was looking for disgruntled bank customers like you asked, and there were a half dozen loans that had been approved by Randy and then killed by Diana\" the Termi- gator\" Cabrera. And I thought you might be interested to see the name of one of them. Do you have everything you need? Oh, it's okay. Found it. And, uh, so did you, apparently. So, here's my question. How long were your parents living in that home before the bank took it away? You know, it's a shame you didn't know someone at the bank that could've helped them keep ahold of it. Oh, wait. You did. Yeah, for all the good it did. Diana said my parents still didn't qualify for a refi. Which was a big, fat lie because you knew Randy had crunched the numbers already and approved that refi, but then Diana killed it, so you killed her. No. I- I sued her. Or, I- I tried to. Tossing them out of the home that they've lived in for 40 years. I mean, insult on top of injury. So you wanted your revenge, and you let your alter ego, Beach on Wheels, take over and you poisoned her. No. Wait. Hold that thought. Colleen? Wait till you hear this. I got tired of waiting for a warrant to open up Bob Butler's safe- deposit box, so I sent Daniel over to Bob Butler's address, where he met the owners of the house... Mr. and Mrs. Lopez.- Bob Butler doesn't exist.- Mm- hmm. And yet he has a home loan from the bank where our victim worked. Sound suspiciously like the work of some loan officer we might know? Who maybe got his hand caught in the cookie jar slamming fraudulent loans. So, what's the score? Um, 57 to 63, Her- icanes. Which half is it? Uh, first half. Not that I called you to give you a play- by- play, Daniel. Were you able to scare up any more loans approved by Arthur Ref- erelli? I'm working on that now. Comparing social security numbers with the list of recent loan applicants. In other words, you've got nothing for me, and I don't even know why I'm talking to you now, so, yeah, I got to go. Keep looking. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go get him. Sorry, ref. But I'm calling off the jam. Come on. Jordan S***, Bernie Brinkerhof Cindy Rogers, Judy Murray, and Bob Butler. All of them applied for a bank loan. All of them were approved. By you. Yeah, I- I process a lot of loans. I don't remember every name, but if their credit's good... Oh, no. Their credit's not the problem. It's, uh, trying to get ahold of them. As in, we can't. I'm sure there's a reason. Oh, if you mean the reason is they're all you. Yeah, most roller- derby people have an alter ego. You have five. And all of their home loans went right in your pocket.- That's ridiculous.- Is it? We followed the money. Over three quarters of a million dollars to an escrow account. Oh, guess what. It's a P. O. Box, and you're listed as one of the officers. I'm sure we'll find the money in some offshore account. Look at me, detective. Do I look like someone who can pull that off? Frankly, no. But Diana, she knew you better, and so you killed her for it. She must have found out about the phantom bank customers and their safety- deposit boxes that you set up to help sell the illusion. She wanted to verify whether they were empty before she reported you, but she never got the chance because you poisoned her. No! Look, I didn't... I didn't poison her. I- I may have had my issues with Diana,- but I would never kill her.- Oh, come on, Artie. You were about to do hard time. She was about to throw you and your pathetic career to the F. E. C. Wolves, and you panicked. All right, look. Even if I did scam the bank for money... Which I'm not saying I did... I did not kill Diana. New tat? Yeah. And it itches like hell. I forgot to put the moisturizer stuff on this morning. Oh, may I? It used to say\" Diana forever,\" and, no, I didn't cover it up after I killed her because, detective, I didn't. Huh. Using infrared photography, this is the original tattoo that was under Diana's Glade- iators tattoo.- Any idea what it means?- I did a little research. It's a gang tattoo for 6 Bang Chicks. The Miami girl gang with a long history of violence? Well, who would've guessed that a successful woman in banking would run with a violent gang? Or maybe guessing had nothing to do with it. Here for some ink or just to ask more annoying questions? Oh, do I get a choice? No, no. Just, uh, one more annoying question about some after- tattoo care. What about it? Keep it out of the sun for the first week and be sure to keep it moisturized. That's the one I wanted to know about, yeah. Anything special you recommend for that? That's what I give everyone. Oh, like the guy with the butt tattoo? It protects the tattoo, and it keeps it from scabbing. Which I'm guessing is especially important for those people that have had tattoos covered up? Like the tattoo that you covered up for Diana? Yeah, you know. The one on her back. The one on the bone so she could be all badass. The one you did recently, like, just days before she was murdered, and then gave her some goop to moisturize, but with a little extra something inside, like rat poison. You know, when we first met, you said family always come first, right? And I just assumed you were talking about the Glade- iators as your family, but that's not true, is it? It's your sister. Please leave her out of this. You said that she died six years ago, and, yes, that's true. But that's not the whole story, is it? She was the unintended victim of a drive- by shooting. The 6 Bang Chicks. Police arrested the shooter, but eye witnesses told of another girl that was in the car, but neither the shooter nor the other four members ever gave up that new recruit, so her identity remained a mystery. That is, until Diana asked you to cover up her old gang tat with a Glade- iators tattoo. What was I supposed to do? She was my sister. She didn't deserve that. She was so funny and so sweet. She didn't deserve to die, and even if Diana didn't pull the trigger herself, I couldn't let her get away with that. I know. That's his fifth of the night, putting the Storm up by three. Yeah, right. Oh, you have the game on. Okay, I'm confused. What happened to the floor seats? Oh, the bribe? Yeah, they're here. No, Jeff and I got halfway there, and we realized you were right. Really? Okay, I realized you were right, but by the time that I dropped Jeff off at Tina's so they could watch the game together, he was totally on board. Whatever. I'm sure that's not what happened, but I'll take it.- So, the Storm are winning?- Yeah. Look, I don't want to harp on this, but Darius is playing really fast and loose with his health. You can't cheat the aging process. Well, maybe he's just trying to get another couple seasons out of it. That's what they all think. But what Darius is doing could lead to a lifelong injury. Darius Locke is on fire. The Storm is now up by 7. Fuller gets it again. You're terrible.==sync, correction by== for www. addic7ed.

Look, whatever you think is going on up there, I am willing to bet Amanda is behind it. She's got Nikita-- Amanda's nowhere near this. Alex started this, and we're gonna finish it. Alex? Your new identity. For the rest of your life. Thank you. This is your numbered account and your severance share. Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. Once everyone gets their cut, we will release the lockdown, throw open the doors, and kiss this place good- bye-- for good. You gotta do something. You need to retake control from Rachel, make the rest of them listen. Listen to what? The truth. The government's never gonna let 300 former convicts turned assassins just disappear without the President's approval. Now look, if you take charge, we can free Michael and restore order. But you need to make them stop following Rachel. I thought you were on board with this. No, that was just so the angry villagers wouldn't tear me to pieces. Alex, if we run, we will be hunted for the rest of our lives. These people are not gonna end up free. They're gonna end up dead. No. Not this time. I will not let that happen again. Again? What do you mean\" again\"? Alex? We have to shut down the trackers. That way, they'll never find us. Tell that to the rogue agents we've already caught. They cut out their trackers, and we still found them. You may be right. I know I am. Rachel, I need to talk to you.- Not now.- Yes now. If there is any hope of us surviving past today, we have to disable Shadownet. Say what? It's too powerful. It has backdoor access to almost every major law enforcement grid in the world. It can access security cams around the world. If we leave it in Division, someone can use it to find us. And you're the only one who can shut it down. Escort Birkhoff to the server room and get it done.- Let's go.- Okay, all right.- Hey.- All right. Sonya will continue the account transfers. Alex, what the hell? I'm sorry, Sean, but I can't let you stop us. No! Stop! Look, just because he's not on board doesn't mean he's a threat. He's just having second thoughts. There is no going back. You said so yourself. That doesn't mean we have to turn on each other. Nobody needs to get hurt. Take him to holding. Hey, this will all work out, trust me. I did. The objective was to use Alex's survivor's guilt. That's why she's so obsessed with making sure everyone in Division gets out of there alive, even if they end up killing themselves in the process. That place is going to tear itself apart.- Don't bet on it.- I wouldn't. If not for Ryan in a coma and Michael locked in a cell. I wouldn't bet on it if you were there. But you're here. Oh, if you're gonna keep talking, Amanda, just kill me now. Not yet. Or ever. You can't kill me. You don't want to. You've had so many chances. As have you, and you couldn't pull the trigger. I didn't want to kill anyone. I never did. That's what you didn't understand. Always so superior. Time for your final lesson. All right, there. You happy? Shadownet's down. Little birds can fly free. If you ask me, you're all a bunch of honey badgers. It's really gone? Oh, it's never gonna be gone. Shadownet not here. Shadownet here. And here. That's true. As long as you're around, Division will always be able to track us. You ever kill anyone, Chris? No. But how hard can it be? It's harder than you think. Believe me. All right, kiddies. Christmas is over. Santa's done giving presents. The place is on lockdown, and I can't get out. And what do you propose I do about it? Send goons or mercs or whatever. Have'em attack the outer perimeter and create a diversion. That way, I can get out of here with the Black Box you told me to get. Your plan's a bit crude. You got a better idea? The elevators have an emergency override. They can be triggered from the server room. Go trigger it.- That's it?- That's it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm being rude to my guest. What did you do to me? Nothing permanent. I just needed to stimulate certain visualization centers the South Ossetia special. You gonna make me see... an imaginary room with a fake girl? No. The people you meet won't be fictitious. Major Matthew Collins, neuropsychiatrist, and his daughter, circa 1987. The room is 8x10, green dresser against peach walls. Pink flowered pillows on an unmade bed. A mirror on the door.\u266a Oh. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work talking to pencil pushers. But I picked up some dinner. Why don't you set the table while I wash up? Amanda, I've had a very hard day. Now is not the time to push me. So please, do as you're asked and set the table. I'm Amanda. I'm Amanda. In Geneva, you demanded I tell you what made me. Be careful what you wish for. Original air date on April 19, 2013== sync, corrected by== We didn't have much, but we didn't need a lot. The army provided for most things. And daddy, well, he wasn't one for decorating. Except for those ducks. He was always obsessed with those damn ducks. They forgot your salad. I'm running back to get it. It was about as ordinary as you could get. What is all this? Isn't it obvious? You wanted to know how it all started. Well, this is where I grew up. So you're gonna show me that a hard life is an excuse for what you've become? It isn't. So just skip to the end. I can't skip to the end. How this ends is up to you. I'm trying to tell you what I remember of my life at that time. And thanks to the psychotropic procedures I've perfected, you're able to simulate your own vision of it. I'm just providing the framework for the story, but your own mind is filling in the details. And your own choices. I'll set the stage, but what happens here is determined by you. It's similar to what I did to Alex in South Ossetia, except she didn't know it was all in her head. I'm granting you the gift of self- awareness. If you want to reveal to me your deepest, darkest secrets, Amanda, cut the theatrics. No. This is something you need to feel, not just hear. It's the only way you'll learn you know nothing about who can and can't be saved. Who is that?\u266a Get out. Are you okay? I said,\" get out!\" He's not here. He went out. Oh, what did he do to you? Amanda, please. You know if father finds you in here, he's going to blame me. And then he's gonna up the dosage, and then-- and then-- No, no, no, no, no, I'm not gonna let that happen, because I'm gonna help you. Oh, you're gonna help me? Daddy's little princess? You can't help me! Or can you, Nikita? When can we get out of here? When are we getting our money? Please, just be patient. Sonya, what's the holdup? Division's accounts are more secure than we thought. A firewall I've never seen before just sprang up. Everything's frozen. Birkhoff. Chris, come in. Chris? Server room. Let's go. Charlie, get that firewall down and free up the money. Yes, ma'am. Ops. I want two- man teams sweeping the entire facility. Find Birkhoff and bring him down. Wait a minute! Don't tell me\" No one needs to get hurt.\" This? This is not like Birkhoff. I know him. He's not a killer. I think Vince would beg to differ. There's got to be more to the story. Look, he didn't shoot Chris. No, just smashed his face. I guess he was having second thoughts. Hands! Don't move! Bring him in! Owen? What are you doing here? Story of my life. I was getting a little stir- crazy waiting for my severance package. Didn't know you guys had a curfew or-- Whoa. Look, I don't want any trouble, okay? I just want to follow the conga line out like everybody else. We didn't do this. Birkhoff did. Post guards near every terminal. That's how he'll come at us. You okay? Birkhoff, huh? Damn. Owen, please. I need you to find him before this gets worse. Can he really hack into any terminal in Division? What matters is that they're gonna kill him, and I can't let that happen.- Okay, okay, okay.- Look, I gotta get back to Ops, but I don't-- Okay. Okay. Dial it down. I'll find him. Something's not right. She's not right, I'm telling you. I saw it. Amanda did something to her. Are you listening to me? Amanda. Yeah, she attacked Nikita and Owen, but she left Owen behind. That's not very Amanda of her. And since then, even before then, Owen's been off the rails. Okay, so are you saying that she did a number on him too? It's the only way to explain it. Explain what? Owen stole the Black Box, and then he attacked me after I caught him trying to sneak away. To where? Back to Amanda? She didn't grab Nikita. He did. Owen gave her up. They're in this together. Hey, look, I know you want to find your girl, but the only way you get to her is if I get through to mine. We have to convince Alex to let us out of here. Derek, call up to Ops. We've got something Alex is gonna want to hear. You're gonna have to try harder than that. Tell her it's about the Black Box and the agent roster on it. She'll listen. Ops, come in. Daddy's work was brilliant. Far ahead of its time. The army knew that post- traumatic stress was going to continue being a problem, so they commissioned him to find a treatment. But he didn't want to just treat PTSD, he wanted to prevent it. He searched for a way to split the moral judgment centers in the brain so that a soldier could engage in the horrors of war, and with the flip of a switch, return home and be a normal citizen. The emotional scars would be locked safely away. The military refused to allow him to conduct clinical trials, so he decided to do them on his own. On his own daughter? Well, that's how much he believed in what he was doing. It was a sacrifice, but that's the benefit of having twins. You can use one as a control.- Amanda!- You're hurting her! Amanda, stop it! You know you cannot interfere. What are you thinking? You risk contaminating the study. This isn't a study. She's your daughter! And Helen knows how important this is. I thought you did too. Now, we've talked about this. This is...\" Important work we're doing.\" Look, it's too dangerous to play games right now. This is no game. They told me you said something about the Black Box. That's right. All this trouble you're going through to give everyone a new life? Their identities are on it. The entire Division roster. Yes, yes. I stopped by Ryan's office on my way down here. The safe is open. The box is gone. Maybe we should talk about this in private? Oh! Don't do that. Do what? Why are you so jumpy? This place has gone all or are you late to the party, as usual? Why don't you give me the gun before you hurt yourself? All right, we gotta get to a terminal, hack the holding cell, and bounce Mikey out of there. System override on the elevators, can you do that from anywhere? Owen, what's wrong with you? Sam. The name is Sam. Now answer the question. Yeah, yes.- Yeah?- Yeah. Okay, let's go. It's right around here. There it is. She said Birkhoff can override doors and elevators from here. At ease, ladies. I found him. Agent double- oh- zero. Do your thing. Don't get cute. What the hell did you do? Nothing. You may now approach the elevators in an orderly fashion. They're out! All right, enough! Let's get out of here. I know this is confusing for you. You hear those... awful sounds coming from downstairs. But you need to know that's not Helen you hear. That's someone else. A part of Helen's mind I've created. And if I succeed with my work, your sister will never remember any of what's happened. you succeed. I succeed. Maybe you're scared because you don't understand my work. If you were more involved, if you could see for yourself... How truly amazing these results really are, I could accomplish so much more with an assistant as brilliant as you. You want me to follow in your footsteps? I knew you'd understand. You were always the smart one, Amanda. Now, I need to get back to work. But I think you should get out of the house. Call one of your friends. Go to the mall. Buy yourself some clothes. So this is where it began... Huh, Amanda? All the manipulation and... the experimentation... Destroying people's lives. You gave up on your sister. You chose your daddy over her. I won't make that choice. I won't make that choice. Watch me. When are you ever going to learn? Let me go! Alex, Alex. I love you. What do you feel? Stop it.- Do you love me?- This isn't about us. I'm making this about us. There are two sides in this, and you need to choose. Me or the mutiny? No. If we stay inside Division, we die. That's not true. They died, Sean, and I lived. Alex, look at me. Alex, look. She did something to you. Amanda did something to you in South Ossetia. Sean, we need to move! I thought you said it was close. They should be. They? Damn it. Alex? Go ahead, pull the trigger. Come on, you heard the man. I can't.' Cause I'm the only one that knows where Nikita is. Helen. Helen. Helen. Go away. We're getting out of here.- You're crazy.- We can leave tonight. He'll find us, and then he'll punish me. No. I need you to trust me. Trust you to do what? Where are we gonna go... Two runaways without a dime? We can go to the police. We'll tell them what he's done. Oh, and you think that they'll believe us? I don't go to school. I don't have a license. The state doesn't even have birth records of me. Father made sure that I don't officially exist! The best thing that could happen to me is I end up in a place like this. Is that what you want, Amanda? So you never have to think of me again? Helen... Let me help you. Please. I'm just so tired of it. The tests. The experiments, the pain. Please. Amanda, make it stop. I will. You will? Oh, I promise. Then please... You have to kill me. It's not an easy choice, is it? Because she really wants to die. So you killed her? Your own sister? I did what I thought I had to do. But it's your turn now. I'm not going to do it. Then you will live with the results, because I'll tell you this: My father's experiments never succeeded, and Helen will carry around the damage he did to her psyche for the rest of her life. And you will be responsible for the consequences that follow. Are you starting to believe me now? Not everyone can be saved. Now there's three of them on the loose: Michael, Birkhoff, and Sean. If you find them unarmed, shoot on sight. No! We start killing each other, and we're lost. We didn't start this. Chris? Birkhoff got the jump on me in the server room. He took my gun and shot down Vincent in cold blood. He would have killed me too but said I needed to live to pass on the message that no one will survive tonight. No! No! There's no way he said that. Does anyone here believe this? Just finish the damn transfers. Rachel, listen to me. No, you listen to me. Most of us will get out of here tonight. Your pals made a different choice. They stashed the Black Box somewhere. With our real identities on it. We need to find where it is. No, we don't. It can burn down with the rest of this place. What'd you think? We'd leave it standing? You can't save everyone, Alex. Go on, guys. Get to it. Too bad Amanda won't be getting her prize. Wasn't for her. I was using her to sell it to the highest bidder. She's the one who told you you could override the elevators, isn't she? I knew you didn't come up with it. You got a big mouth when my gun isn't in it. Let's see yours. Birkhoff, we need to get topside. Will the hack still work?- It should.- Good, let's go.- We can't, not all of us.- Why not? Once the hack's open, I gotta stay with it, make sure the kids in Ops don't shut it down. Otherwise, you guys could get stuck between floors. Well, I'm not leaving you behind. Well, I'm not leaving without Sonya. So there. I got goose bumps.- Shut up.- There's a panel nearby. I can hack it in 30 seconds. Michael, you go. I'm not leaving Alex behind, and I can't let Birkhoff be braver than me. Come on, come on. Let's go, Birkhoff. I'm moving as fast as I can.- Hurry it up, man.- I'm hurrying. All right. Work faster. At least give me a gun. No way. But you can take this back. It's gonna get hot in a second. If I'm gonna get Nikita back, I'm gonna need you and that in one piece. So stay low and stay quiet. Soon as the elevator doors open, I'll push them off. My hero. Birkhoff. Get that elevator back down here! He's out! Mikey's out! So am I!\u266a What about Michael? Birkhoff hacked the elevator, so he could escape. Took Owen with him. Owen? They had the Black Box. That's got the whole roster on it. Our new identities will be useless. Should've thought about that before you tried to whack me in the server room. I knew it. No, please. No, no, no, no, no. You think I wanna hunt you? You think I want the government to hunt you? I am you! No, please. No, you were Percy's little stooge. And then Nikita. And then Ryan. You're management, and this has been a long time coming. No! Alex! Stop! Stop! Enough! It's over! Can't you see that? Just'cause they're dead doesn't mean we stay. You can't kill all of us. You wanna go? Go! What are you looking at me for? I don't give the orders around here! You wanna stay? Stay! You wanna go? Go. Helen? Helen, come on, we're going.- I told you...- I don't care. We're getting out of here. Let's go. Why is she out of her room? You're not gonna hurt her anymore. I'm disappointed in you, Amanda. I thought we had an understanding. You, back downstairs. Now! I told you, get back to your room. Oh! No! No! I could have gotten us out. Why? Daddy's princess has to ask why? Why I wanted to hurt someone who kept saying that they were gonna help me, but waited and did nothing for years. You knew what was happening downstairs, but you let me suffer. And why? Because I was born eight minutes later than you? I could have been you. I should have been you! Father did me a favor, because Helen doesn't exist... But Amanda does. You're Amanda. I told you I was so much worse than all you bitches put together. You were Helen... The whole time. Your sister tried to help you, and you killed her? She tried to save herself. She couldn't bear the guilt of how she... stood by, did nothing, told no one. She thought that if she saved me, it would absolve her of everything. Sound familiar? You see Alex as living proof that you can be redeemed, but the truth is you can't. You can't really save people, can you? You slaughtered your family. You had the freedom to make your own choices, and the story ended up the same. No, your lesson means nothing. For now. But soon, you will know the truth of it. You did something to me while I was out. What did you do? I used our time together wisely. What did you do to me? I thought I'd never make it out of that freaking hellhole. Whoa. Kind of in the middle of something here. We had a deal. Time to hold up your end. Fine, just let me finish, and then you'll get what you want. You know what? I've waited long enough. Now you've messed with enough people's heads. We leave now, or I'm putting a bullet in yours. If you shoot me, neither one of us get what we want. Just let me finish with Nikita, and then we'll go. I can't let you do that. Don't tell me you've gone soft. Don't blame him. I put a tracker on that box right after we got it from Ari. Now, put the box down and back away from Nikita. And here I thought you trusted me.- Nikita.- You have to get Amanda. She's gone. What about the Black Box? Can we track it? Amanda is gonna have to wait. Division? We need to get back. You might live to regret that, Sam. You might not live, period. I went through hell to get this back. Now it's your time to deliver. I want the names of the contacts we can sell these secrets to. I want my money. And then I never want to see any of your faces again. Well, you're a man who seems to really know... Hey. Shut up and drive. Are you guys okay? I think so. Okay. Sean, are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Let me catch my breath. I think I cracked a rib. You need to go to medical. Are there even any medics left? One. She's looking after Ryan. Sean, there's something that I have to tell you... about Ryan. You're the one who shot him.- How did you know?- Hey. When I mentioned his name in the storage room, your reaction... I mean, that's when I became certain that you were not the Alex I know. I didn't mean to shoot him. I didn't mean-- I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I- I swear I didn't. Sean, you have to believe me. This whole time, the thing that matters to me the most-- Saving everyone. I know. No, you don't know. I couldn't save my father. I couldn't save Larissa. And I- I couldn't save those girls that I left behind in the brothel. What's done is done. I just want my girl back. Now, help me get to medical. You know, one thing good, I can finally use that big screen to start watching some Sean! Sean! You got shot! Somebody, help! I can't find an exit wound. Where's the blood? Must be internal bleeding. What? I've seen this before. Bullet gets lodged in there... and nicks a major artery. There's nothing you can do.- No!- Alex. Promise me... you'll find a way to get better. No, don't think about that now. Please! Please, somebody, help! Hey. Alex, just promise me. I promise. Hey, Sean. Look, you were wrong before, when you said the thing that matters to me the most was saving everyone. You were wrong. What I was trying to say is the thing that matters to me the most... is you. Hey. This is where we first met. Hey.\u266a No!\u266a\u266a What happened? Is there anyone left? A dozen or so. You guys need to get to Ops.\u266a This was Rachel's doing? Yeah, he bled out internally. Where's Alex? She said she was gonna stay. She was waiting for you. When we found Sean here, she was gone. Kept saying she was trying to save everyone. I guess, in the end, she couldn't save him. Not everyone can be saved.\u266a== sync, corrected by", "imdb_url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2795052", "imdb_id": "tt2795052", "year": "2013", "rated ": "TV-14", "genre": "Action, Crime, Drama", "plot": "Subjected to Amanda's horrific mental conditioning process, Nikita is sent on a terrible trip through memory lane.

That guy's here every week, never leaves a tip. Not once. This is from the tap in Savino's office. Tell Nono I got it handled. The sandwich is getting out with the avocado. You hungry? I'm hungry. We think\" Nono\" is Frank Novarro, the Chicago boss, and\" the sandwich\" is what they call the skim. And what's\" the avocado\"? What? Or Well, whoever it is, he's the one that's getting the skim past the feds and out of the savoy. I say we bring in byrne and the feds. See if anyone in their files goes by that nickname. If you bring in the feds, I- I can't protect Mia. Do you want to get Savino or not? Yeah, but I.... Then we need to bring in the feds. It's our best shot. She's right, Jack.\u266a aw, yeah do me a favor, sweetie. Keep it close.

How about a little something for the girl in the ladies' room? Of course. I'll be right back. Mm. Hold the fort, will you? Mm- hmm. Good evening. Yes, it is. Lena. Vincent. Why haven't I seen you here before? You mean, where have I been all your life? I mean, obviously you know your way around a casino. Just surprised I haven't seen you in the savoy before. Well, I'm not from around here. Haven't been to Vegas in years. Oh? What brings you back? I'm meeting someone. Someone I haven't seen in a long time. Well, whoever he is, he's a very lucky man. He's not a he. Katherine? You know, once the feds find out about the tap on Savino's phone, Mia's gonna get caught up in this mess. I'm not even sure if she's involved in the skim. Well, then she has nothing to worry about. Well, the way byrne's been gunning for her, I'm not so sure. Is there anything you can do to, you know, talk to her? Warn her somehow? Jack, I can't compromise the investigation. I know. I'd do it myself if she'd listen. Katherine, if there's anything you can do to help Mia, anything at all... I got to get back to work. At this hour? Someone's got to run this place. You run the savoy? Yup. Well, then you must know my daughter. She works here. No kidding? What's her name? Mia Rizzo. You're Lena Rizzo? That's impossible. Lena Rizzo is dead. Vincent... Do I look dead to you? Sync and correction by GeirDM www. addic7ed. com Katherine, what are you doing here? Thought you were finishing up the andersen brief. Sorry. I got distracted. New developments in the Savino investigation. Really? What you got? Got a strong lead on how the skim is getting past the feds and out of the savoy. How? Well, the sheriff's department put a tap on Savino's phone. Here, look at these transcripts. He keeps mentioning the same guy.\" The avocado,\" he calls him. We think he's the one ferrying the skim from the savoy to the Chicago courier. Huh. Any idea who this guy is, this\" avocado\" character? No, not yet, but with the FBl's resources, it should be just a matter of time before... FBl? I thought you said this was the sheriff's department. Lamb decided to bring byrne and the bureau in on this. We can't take any chances. Are you okay? What? Eddie bade? The guy nearly kills three people in those b and e's, and he's up for parole already? Yeah. Yeah, good behavior... what you gonna do? The paper says he made a big spectacle in the court when you put him away. Threatened to get his revenge. Are you worried about him getting out? Trust me... Eddie bade is the last thing I'm worried about. This place is a madhouse. I know. I love it. Maybe we should go to my meeting at capitol records first and come back here later. Tommy went through a lot of trouble setting this up, and I don't want to be late, Dixon. Relax, I'm gonna get you there on time. Name, please? Dixon lamb. Here to see Violet mills. Is she expecting you? No, actually. I'm here to surprise her. Really? Pull up here, make a u- turn at the stop sign, proceed through the exit gate. Wait, you're not letting us in? Nah. Have a good day. Great. Now what? Background extras, let's go! Let's go, we need to hurry it up. Mia. Miss O'Connell. Please call me Katherine. I'm glad we ran into each other. I was hoping we could talk, actually. I have nothing to say to the district attorney. I'm not here as an a. D. A., I'm here to talk woman to woman. Savino's going down. And it's not a question of if, but when. Did Jack put you up to this? I've already told the FBl: I'm not a rat. No, you're an educated, professional woman who works for a very powerful man. And I also know that sometimes, you have to do what he tells you to, whether you think it's all right or not. Do you think Savino wouldn't hang you out to dry in a second if it suited him? He will not protect you, Mia. But I will. Protect me? From what? You could be looking at 25 years on multiple fraud counts. But not if you tell me the names of Savino's friends in Chicago. If you were so close to nailing Savino like you said, you would've already had those names, so let me tell you something, Katherine, woman to woman. Making empty threats really undermines your authority. Just a little tip from one working girl to another. Should have brought my sweater. Yeah. I told you to go with the spaceman, but no, you wanted to go with the alien princess. Here goes nothing. Dixon! What are you doing here? Well, come in. Come in. Oh, who's that? Oh, that's Yvonne. Yvonne Sanchez. Hi. Well, you- you coming in? Uh, yeah, I- I don't think so. I have an audition, so, uh... Yup, coming in. What are you doing in L. A.? Turns out, forgetting you ain't so easy to do. And Yvonne had an audition out here, so... Every girl deserves a cowboy. You should have told me you were coming. Thought you'd be happy to see me. I am happy. It's just... With the movie and everything... You know, we should get going anyway. We're gonna be late for capitol records. Here, go ahead, take the car. I'm gonna stay here with Violet. I can't. Dixon, I've got plans. So? Cancel. I can't. I'm sorry. Oh. Well, sorry to bother you. Dixon, wait. Don't be like that. I am happy to see you. I just... I can't see you tonight. Okay? I'll see you out. Violet? Oh. Hi! Hi. Mmm.- What's the cowboy doing here?- Oh. Dixon is in town with his girlfriend, Yvonne. Ah, his girlfriend, huh? Yup. That's me. Yes, sir. We're just in town for some auditions, and my girl here... she's a hell of a singer. Well, is that right? Mm- hmm. You know that space picture we're doing on stage 12? What is that? That's, uh... We got to talk to costumes about that, huh? You know, we really should be going. Yeah. Wait, wait. Oh. As long as they're in town, your friends ought to join us tomorrow night. I'm having a little get- together at my place. Nothing fancy. What do you say, huh? See you tomorrow night. Terrific. Come on, baby. Great. That's wonderful. Fabulous. Hi, miss O'Connell. Hey. Jack, I spoke to Mia. Yeah? And? She wasn't very interested in what I had to say. I'm sorry. I tried. Katherine? I just got a call from a neighbor reporting a possible break- in at your boss's house. You seen Reynolds? No. I'll call him at his office and tell him to meet us there. Already did that. Secretary said she hadn't seen him all morning. That's strange. Let's take a ride. Yeah. If the d. A. Gets robbed, is that irony or just bad luck? It's bad something. Look at that. You stay here. Reynolds? Jack's next door talking to the neighbor. Oh, my God, is that blood? Damn sure is. We got something more than just a simple- breaking and entering here.- Neighbor saw a powder blue Ford tearing out of here right after hearing a commotion. They get the plate number? She's saying there were no plates. Well, then the kidnapper must have taken them off. You think Reynolds was kidnapped? We got a break- in, kidnapper we got signs taken them off. Of a struggle, we got blood, but no body. We got a strange car fleeing the scene. Who'd want to kidnap Reynolds? Eddie bade. Reynolds put him away for a string of armed robberies. He was paroled on good behavior. Got out a couple days ago. All right, Jack, get on the radio, tell them we're looking for a parolee by the name of Eddie bade driving that powder blue Ford, and we think he may have Reynolds. You wanted to see me? Yes. Mia, this is Lena, friend of ours from Florida. Well, I'll leave you two alone. What's this about? Mia, um... I'm your mother. Hmm. My mother's dead. I know that's what he told you. My mother is dead. I'm so sorry. This must be a tremendous shock for you. I... I... I brought these, um, baby pictures, your birth certificate. I figured you'd want proof. My mother left when I was two and died shortly after. No, that's not what really happened. As far as I'm concerned, it is. And even if you are who you say you are... a mother who abandons her own child, doesn't call, doesn't write, doesn't visit, nothing... and she's not dead, well, she might as well be. It's not that simple. With your father, nothing was. He thought I was cheating on him. Were you? No. I swore to him up and down on my mother's grave. What good is that? For all we know, your mother could be secretly alive, too. Anyway, Johnny didn't believe me. Told me to get lost. Said that if I ever tried to see you or contact you again, he would kill me. I had good reason to believe him. Oh, for your sake, Mia, I hope he changed. I hate to think of you growing up without a mother, and a father like that. Why are you here? I know what it's like to be alone. No family, no one to rely on but yourself. I just wanted you to know that you're not alone in this world. You have to see it. This is incredible. Dixon! Here he is. So glad you could make it. And yvette, right? Hardly recognize you out of your costume. That's\" B\u00e9same mucho.\" Actually, it's Abel cervantes. Kid's the next Desi Arnaz. Just signed him to a three- picture deal. Excuse me. Be right back. Sure. Merv? Meet me in the cabana.\" B\u00e9same mucho\" is the name of the song, not the singer.\u266a\u266a This was my grandma's favorite bolero.\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a No, we shouldn't be doing this. Not here. It's too dangerous. Oh, I love dangerous.\u266a\u266a Oh, no, no, no. I should go, before Barry gets suspicious. You know, you really ought to stop thinking about old Barry so much. Let's see what we can do to take your mind off that, huh?\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a Beautiful job. Your boyfriend was right. You are a hell of a singer. Thank you. Wonderful voice. Now, listen, I'm casting a new musical. I want you to audition for me. Come by my office tomorrow at 3: 00. All right? I'd... We've got a situation. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Some guy over there in the bushes taking pictures. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Wait a minute, guys. Guys. Oh. Oh!- You like taking pictures?!- Wait. Come on. Oh, geez. I see you around here taking pictures, I'll break your legs. Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Was that Bade's sister? Yup. She confirmed that he's been staying there ever since he got out, but... He hasn't been home since day before yesterday. Huh. Got any leads on that blue Ford? I got to thinking, what if whoever was driving that Ford didn't remove the plates? What if he never had them to begin with? It's a new car. So, I called don munroe over at munroe Ford. And guess who bought a powder blue Fairlane, in cash, day before yesterday. Eddie bade. Eddie bade. All right, everybody, listen up. I want Eddie Bade's mug shot and a photo of Reynolds sent out to every newspaper and TV station in town. Tell them the disappearance of the district attorney is now officially a missing persons case, and that Eddie bade is the prime suspect. Looks like Katherine was right. Okay. Come on, baby, come on. Hard ten! Yes! You're a real good luck charm. Thank you. Uh, aren't you forgetting something? Yeah. Oh, come now. Don't be stingy. Here you go, Bobby. Thanks. Thank you, miss Lena. Her story checks out. I made a couple of calls. Way I hear it, she'd show up every couple of years, check to see if Johnny had changed his mind about letting her see you. Course, he never did. I can't believe that's my mother. I'm standing here right now looking at my mother. You'll be okay. People like you and me, we always end up okay. Something's rotten with the avocado. Come on. Spokesman for sheriff lamb identified this man, recent parolee Eddie bade, as the prime suspect in the disappearance of Clark county district attorney Jerry Reynolds. Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to call the sheriff's department hotline... All right, I'll call you back. Tony boy says Reynolds never showed last night. Which means the skim never made it back to Chicago. Nono's already pissed off about the FBI busting the skim, now this? So what do we do? You're my second in command. What do you think? I think I call Paulie shells, have him front us the cash until we find out what happened to Reynolds and the skim. Nono and them will get their money by this time tomorrow. You just tell me who's supposed to get what, and I'll take care of it. Names, dates, everything you need right there. Once you get done with that, I want you to put word out on the street that I'm looking for Reynolds. And my money.$25. Cash up front. That's just the basics. Extras are extra. Extras? Whips, chains, handcuffs... No handcuffs. Hmm. Eddie bade? Yeah. You're under arrest. But we're outside Clark county lines; I didn't break any laws. Not for solicitation. For kidnapping. Kidnapping? What? What are you talking about? Ma'am. So, you're buying cars... Hitting the cathouse. You just been enjoying your freedom, haven't you, Eddie? I didn't break any laws. Oh, you been in there a long time, so tell me, where'd you get all that money to have all that fun? Reynolds gave it to me. Now, why in the hell would he do that? All I know is, he showed up at my sister's place, a- and I thought he was gonna shake me down for some of my old contacts or something. Instead, he hands me a stack of cash, says all I got to do is buy a car and drop it off at his house. Did he say why he needed the car? No. Just to buy it in my name. Then he told me to get out of town, so I did. Straight across the county line to the first brothel. A man has needs. I didn't break any laws. You mentioned that. So can I go? Yeah, you can go. Just don't leave town. So Reynolds staged his own kidnapping? I think I know why. We know from the phone transcripts that Savino told his contact,\" the towels never made it to the laundromat\" in other words, the skim was never delivered. So what does that have to do with Reynolds, agent byrne? The surveillance reports show that your d. A. Has been making regular visits to the savoy for weeks. I'm thinking that maybe he was the one that picked up the towels. Wait, you think Reynolds was in on the skim? He was at the savoy just before he disappeared. So when you told him about the bug, he panicked, he took Savino's money and he took off. And then he framed Eddie bade to throw all of us off the scent. Yeah. I can't believe this. Reynolds, the avocado? That's... Not what Savino was saying at all. I picked up a little Italian in the war. He was saying With a\" t.\" It means\" lawyer\" what's Italian for\" vanished into thin air\"? Okay. If Reynolds is on Savino's payroll, then he would have cash on hand... lots of it. He didn't even have a safe in his house. So he stashed it. We find the money, we find him. How you gonna do that? You think the d. A.' S hiding his dirty money down at the local bank? No. Not the local bank. Hello, counselor. So all this time we've been working to bring down Savino, and you have thwarted us at every turn. My God, Jerry, how many bodies are out there in the desert because of you? Starting with sheriff Clyde Olson. Well, my money says this started way before Clyde. Good luck proving it. No, we don't need luck. Once a jury hears that the man they elected to protect them from criminals became one himself... Savino threatened me, Katherine; I had no choice. Do not play the victim with me. You obviously don't know what he's capable of. You obviously don't know what I'm capable of. You're going away, counselor, for the rest of your life. And that may not be too long, because convicts, they don't tend to play nice with the fellas that put them away. It's gonna be real rough in there for you. Unless... you continue to work for Savino, and you report back to us his criminal activity. Oh, wait a minute, byrne. We didn't discuss this. I'm listening. I want names. Names of all his associates back in Chicago. Are you kidding me? He disappeared with the skim, and you expect him to walk back into Savino's office like nothing ever happened? Savino's a lot of things, but he's not stupid. I understand the risks. He understands the risks. What do you think, Katherine? I think considering the damage he's done, it's the least he could do. Knock them off slow... I want plenty of time with Violet. Dixon, you're better than this. And you deserve better than a girl who makes you sneak around behind her boyfriend's back. Why do you care? We're just having fun. Not like you know anything about having fun. I know what I see, and you are in way over your head with this girl. I just don't want to see you get hurt. Yvonne, you are not my mother and this ain't my first rodeo. Yvonne. Is that... Mussolini? Sure is. Are you Italian? Mexican. Mexican. Mm- hmm. I prefer Italian. You work here, that's what you'll be. Ever hear of Rita Hayworth? Of course. What about Margarita Carmen Cansino? No. Who is she? Same girl. She's who Rita was before Harry cohn got his hands on her. Imagine that. Cheers. Point is, it's not where you start, it's where you end up. Mm- hmm. Uh, so, will there be an accompanist? Uh, no, no. It's just you and me. But I thought this was an audition. It is. Do you know why my pictures are hits? No. Because I know what the public wants. But for them to want you, I have to want you. So... make me want you. I think I should go. What? Worried about what your boyfriend might say? Hmm? Ah, he's not really your boyfriend, is he? Is he? Come on. You think I don't know about him and Violet, huh? Uh, I'm leaving. Not so fast. Not so fast, you little I... Get over here! Come here! You like it tough? You like it rough, huh? No. No. No. I don't care how it happened... I want my money. Mr. Jenkins, what seems to be the problem? I am missing three$5, 000 chips. That's...$15, 000. I know. What happened? I say she shorted me. She says the chips were stolen. Either way, the savoy is responsible. I deserve to be made whole. Susan, give Mr. Jenkins three$5, 000 chips, and write it up as a marker under my name. Is there anything else we can do for you? You can get to the bottom of this so it doesn't happen again. Oh, I assure you, I will. Thank you, miss Rizzo. Now, didn't your father teach you any manners? It's customary to ask permission before rifling through someone else's drawers. Oh? And what's Emily post's position on grand theft? Hey, I made a lot of money for that guy Jenkins. Way I see it, I'm just taking my cut. That's funny, I don't think Vincent Savino will see it that way. Or sheriff lamb. Honey, don't kid yourself. You and I, we're in the same line of work. The only difference is, I work for myself. You steal on behalf of gangsters who will turn on you the minute you so much as look at them wrong. Well... This is shaping up to be quite the family reunion. Mia, I want to know you. And I want you to know me. Well, this is me. Take it or leave it. I'm gonna need time to think about that. I'm no mother. And I won't pretend to offer maternal advice. Protect yourself. Because they sure as hell won't protect you. I ought to know. I'm gonna have to tell Vincent about these. Well, then you're in luck. You rea...? Mia. Will you be joining us this evening? Actually, uh... I was just leaving. Hey, Georgie. You know, for a woman who hasn't been in Vegas in years, you certainly are friendly with all these high- rollers. They're not my friends. More like business associates. Is that what this is... you and me... just business? I'd say the other night was more about pleasure, wouldn't you? Anyway, the way I see it, my business is good for your business. Couldn't agree more. I bring the players to your casino... And you keep them here, spending more and more money. Exactly. Everybody wins. Well, not everyone. But you certainly make them feel like winners, and that's quite a skill. What's the matter? Those towels you're looking for... I think I found them. I'm so sorry, Lena. I got to cut this short. No apologies. Business comes first. I understand. Thank God. I've been here for hours. Untie me! God. Where's my money? I've got it. Don't worry. Now hurry up and untie me. Always in a rush, counselor. Hey, bade could walk through that door any minute. What's a bade? That's the guy who grabbed me. I paid him off to keep him from killing me. I had to wire him every cent from my bank in Elko, but for all I know, he could walk through that door any minute, looking to put a bullet in my head. Might be the easy way out for you. What kind of name is bade? What is that, French? Now untie me, would you? For God's sake, Vincent, what... What are you waiting for? The skim is just sitting there in my driveway, burning a hole in the trunk of my car. Your trunk? You got to be kidding me. Don't they teach you about crime in law school? It's about time. You're welcome. Hey, there you are. Waited outside silver's office for about an hour. What the hell happened? I took a taxi. What's this? You're leaving? Yup. I'm driving home tonight. You can come with me or not. I don't care. Look, Yvonne, if this is about what I said earlier, I'm sorry. Not everything is about you, Dixon! Who did that to you? Nobody. Let me see that. Who did this to you, huh? Silver. Oh, my God, Barry did that? I'm gonna kill him. No, no, no. Dixon, wait. You don't understand what kind of man he is. That tells me everything I need to know about what kind of man he is. You do not want to make an enemy of him. The man has his own police force, for God's sake. I saw them, Dixon, last night at the party. They caught a photographer in the bushes, and then smashed his camera across his face. I'm not scared of him. I am. If you go after him he could take it out on me. He bought it hook, line and sinker. Reset the skim for later tonight. Get names. I want to know who that money is going to in Chicago. Otherwise, there's no deal. I know what you need. I'm a district attorney. Not anymore. Where's the meeting at? The usual spot. The mausoleum, woodlawn cemetery. I don't like it. It's isolated. There's only one road in and out of that place. Tail's gonna have to stay at least a mile back. No, no, no. You put a tail on me, you blow my cover. He's right. Sheriff, I put word on the street and got Savino to that motel in a matter of hours without any suspicion. The wheels of this thing are in motion, okay? Let's not gum up the works now. Well, God forbid I stand in the way of progress. What happened to your date? Duty called. Oh, men like Savino... business always comes first. You ought to know that by now. Mickey, her drinks are on me. Hello? This the guy who kidnapped you? Yeah, that's him. No! Shut up! Then you do the honors. Are you cr- crazy, Vincent? I'm the district attorney. I can't kill a man in cold blood. Is that it? Or is it that you can't kill an innocent man? Because you say he kidnapped you, but Mr. bade here tells us a different story. Now I don't know what to believe. Believe me, I'm telling you the truth, Vincent. Then prove it. I'm sorry.\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a a rainbow\u266a got the string around my finger\u266a\u266a what a world, what a life\u266a I'm in lo...\u266a I got a song that I sing please.

[ groaning ] Yield now, and I will grant you both quick deaths.- Pass.- What he said. How is it possible that Bruce Wayne has never set foot inside the A. R. G. U. S. club? It's not due to a lack of effort on their part. I get more mail from them than I do from credit card companies, and it all goes in the shredder.- Why?- Not interested. If I want to unwind, I'll get out of Gotham. The A. R. G. U. S. club is getting out of Gotham. And the best part is you don't have to leave Gotham to get there. That's why I love it. You know what? You're coming as my guest.- Next week, no excuses.- Let's go to Bora- Bora instead. Bora- Bora? That's a pretty serious trip for a guy who's not known for getting serious, Mr. Wayne. Well, maybe I'm more serious than you think, Ms. Ravencroft. Aw, come on! Those goons never even touched me. This game is rigged. Silver Monkey: Hello, Katana. [ grunts ] I'm not here to fight. All I want is the sword. Then you're gonna be disappointed. [ yells ] [ groans ] Bring the sword to me, or there will be consequences. [ coughs ] We need to talk. If you're here to apologize about the limo again, don't worry. The damage those vandals did when you went to grab a bite is completely covered by insurance, no harm done. It wasn't vandals, Mr. Wayne. It was a member of the League of Assassins named Silver Monkey.- What's going on, Alfred?- Just listen, Bruce. About a year ago, I infiltrated the League of Assassins as a ClA operative. While I was inside I discovered something of immeasurable value to the League. The Soultaker sword. I saw this sword in action. It drains souls from helpless targets. It was clearly an abomination too dangerous to leave in the hands of the League or the government. So I faked my own death and the sword's destruction to slip away undetected. I've been lying low with the sword ever since, trying to figure out my next move, but Silver Monkey saw the sword when he broke into the manor, and now he wants it for himself. Why am I just hearing about this now? It's not her fault, Bruce. Tatsu confided in me after she began working here. I kept it from you to protect her. She was just doing what she thought was right, but I betrayed your trust.- And?- And... I think the only appropriate solution is for me to tender my resignation. [ gasps ] Accepted. What? No, you can't do that! And since I can no longer trust either of you, both of you will be gone by the time I get back. It's okay, you don't have to tell me anything. I don't have to know what happened to know you feel betrayed by those you trusted most. Trust is overrated. I think I'm gonna give it a rest for a while. Good idea. If you and I start trusting each other, we might get serious. Point taken, Doc. Let's get out of here. I know a place where trust isn't an issue. Let me guess. The A. R. G. U. S. club. Give it a chance, Bruce. They've been like family to me. They can be the same to you if you let them. I'm in your hands. Neat trick. That's nothing. You're about to be blown away. Trust me.- They have electricity, right?- They have everything. The A. R. G. U. S. club ritual room. So much history here. Wars begun and ended. And enemies revealed. [ car horn honking ] I have a question. Does the A. R. G. U. S. club control the League of Assassins, or is it the other way around? Keep asking questions. Maybe one of them will be your last. You know, I've always argued that no one needs therapy more than therapists, and now you're proving my theory. A keen insight. It's a shame you have no one in your life to appreciate it. Said the shrink with the crossbow and the ninja boyfriend. I mean, you and the monkey guy are together, right? If you don't keep your mouth shut, I will shut it for you. Just making conversation. [ gasps ]- Release Wayne.- You are in no position to negotiate. No? Maybe I should take that up with Lady Shiva. Now, the sword. You want it? Come and get it. You know what we all have in common? Nothing. You're right, Mr. Wayne. [ groans ] They won't stop me. Nothing will. That remains to be seen.- Is that all you've got?- Not even close. This wasn't the plan. You said Wayne wouldn't have to die. If you miss him, you may join him. [ groans ] One of these days your luck will run out. Oh, I do, every day. Hey, didn't I fire you? I brought the things you requested. She could probably use a hand in there. Need a hand? Help yourself to the ninjas. Silver Monkey's mine. Yield now, and I will grant you both quick deaths.- Pass.- What he said. You will now learn the true power of the Soultaker sword It has been a vessel of power for more than 1, 000 years and it has hosted the souls of conquerors and conquered alike. Just as it will host yours. And yours when the sword is turned against you. By Lady Shiva. Is she right? What about Lady Shiva? I have the sword. Lady Shiva is no longer a concern. I was just thinking the same thing about you, Silver Monkey. and you are not me. Seize her. Seize Lady Shiva now! I'm afraid they fear me more than they fear you, old friend. [ Silver Monkey groans ] [ grunts ] Oh, the flower you picked has lovely petals, Silver Monkey. I wonder if the same is true of her soul. Please, Lady Shiva. I never meant to betray you!- It was Silver Monkey who...- Shh, shh. Quiet now, my lotus blossom. [ chanting incantation ] What are you doing? No! Don't! Don't worry, my friends, she's not dead. Not yet. As for you, Silver Monkey, you won't be joining your flower in the sword. My plans for you are far more interesting and painful. I'm actually quite grateful to Silver Monkey. Yes, he betrayed me, but he also subdued two of my most troublesome adversaries. This is a most welcome windfall for me and for the sword.- You forgot one thing.- Did I? And what is that?- The rocket.- What rocket? That rocket.- Glove saws?- Acid capsules. But good idea. We're not going anywhere, and neither are you. What he said. [ grunting ] [ grunting ] A promising start. I sincerely hope you survive so we can finish this properly. Farewell for now or forever.- We have to stop her.- We have to go. You're not going to tell me where we're going?- And you're holding me against my will.- If you want out, just say so. Now what? I'm aware of your history with the League of Assassins. Thank you, but I don't need your approval. I knew you smuggled the sword into Gotham on a cargo freighter. And I knew Bethanie Ravencroft was conspiring with Silver Monkey. They intended to leverage Bruce Wayne for the sword right from the start. If you knew all that, why didn't you do something about it? I did. I used you to turn the League of Assassins against itself, and it worked. It worked? Bruce Wayne is dead, Your hands are as dirty as the League's.- It didn't work perfectly.- You're even crazier than I thought. Good luck with that. If we meet again, it won't be as friends. Before you go, I need to show you something. I've seen enough. [ gasps ] I'm just fine. I regret what happened to Bethanie, regardless of her intentions. As for the Soultaker sword, we're going to get it back... together. And you aced it.

{"title": "Vice Winners & Losers", "content": "This week on\" Vice\"... Ryan meets polygamy's teenage outcasts. I don't know where to go, how to start. What do I do? And then we send Thomas to Mauritania where thin is ugly... _ and fat is beautiful. And then I travel to India... So clear- cut, because it's poverty and then super rich. to see how their 99% have been affected by the global economic crisis. _ The world is changing. Now, no one knows where it's going. But we'll be there uncovering the news... It's World War ill. culture... and politics that expose the absurdity of the modern condition. That little child has a huge gun. This scene isn't really kosher by American standards. I was interviewing suicide bombers and they were kids. This is the world through our eyes. We win or we die! This is the world of\" Vice\". Hi. I'm Shane Smith, and we're here in the\" Vice\" Offices in Brooklyn, New York. For our first story this week, we go to Arizona and Utah. When Warren Jeffs was arrested and sent away for life, most of us assumed that the story would end there. Now, 5 years after his conviction for having sex with 12- and 15- year- old brides, reports have surfaced that Jeffs is still ruling his polygamist community. He's just doing it from prison. So we sent Ryan to the heart of polygamy country to see what happens when a lunatic runs an entire town from his jail cell. _ And in your teenage years, you will be tested. Are you listening to the Gentile music? Then you don't have the spirit of God. Are you watching the Gentile movies? How can you be trusted with a family? Warren Jeffs is the pedophile polygamist leader of the FLDS, the Fundamentalist Latter- Day Saints, a radical offshoot of Mormonism. Jeffs is currently serving a 130- year jail sentence for his 2011 conviction of child sex and bigamy charges, including the sexual assault of his 12- and 15- year- old brides. You know, whether it's directly or indirectly, they're still getting all their marching orders from Warren Jeffs in Texas Prison. Jeffs has banned bicycles, ordered all children's toys to be destroyed, and recently made yet another strange declaration. It is polygamy gone berserk. Only 15 men will be allowed to father children with the thousands of eligible FLDS women. As the prophet, he controls everything-- jobs, money, property, and most importantly, who his followers can marry, because the number of wives a man has is the most crucial element of the Fundamentalist Mormon. In fact, Jeffs himself is thought to have up to 78 wives. Having multiple wives is so important that only higher- ranking elders are allowed to start families, And that leaves the younger men in the community with a problem: grade school math. In order to practice polygamy, you have a guy with 50 wives, 49 guys have gotta go somewhere. Roman was only 18 when he was exiled from the church. They wanna get him out, so they kick him out for absolutely any reason. You know, you watch a movie, you talk to a girl, you listen to music, they kick you out. The nearest cities, is where they go to. St. George, Salt Lake. Lately they've been going up to the oil refineries in North Dakota because the money's good up there and they don't have to have an education, because most of them don't have even an 8th grade education. So there's a whole community of ex- FLDS kids that live here in Salt Lake now. They hang out together all the time. Some of them are getting together for some pizza and beer and they invited us to join. I seriously didn't masturbate till 6 months after I left. Want to know what's funny, dude? How old were you? 17. How did you stay away from your dick? I peed out of it. That's all I knew. I started when I was 11. I felt so guilty. That's the worst part. When you grow up in the vacuum of the FLDS, things that most of us think of as common knowledge, like paying bills, using the internet, or even wearing bathing suits are completely alien to them. These kids are shockingly unprepared for the most mundane of tasks in everyday life. My dad, he kept on telling me,\" If you don't stop texting, or don't stop--\" you keep buying Internet for your phone, you're going to have to be kicked out of the house.\" I called up Sam, my older brother, and he came and picked me up that night. What was that first night like, when you decided to call your brother? I don't know where to go, how to start. What do I do? How long does that last? How long does it take to feel like-- It took me, I'm going to say, 2 1/ 2, 3 years. To feel just comfortable here. Wayne and Joe offered to show us around their hometown of Colorado City. You really can't explain the way that you feel the first day you leave. There's no words to describe the feeling. You're scared, you're terrified, but you're excited all at the same time. To them, they think we're the worst people. Like fuck you, you're brainwashed, I'm better than you. Wayne and Joe told us about some kids who'd been thrown out, just like them. But instead of running away as far as they could, they stayed in Colorado City, a few blocks from the families that now refuse to acknowledge them. You know what happens when you grow up with like 30 brothers? You play really aggressive sports. I'm up.- Oh!- Nice. So these kids live in what they call butthuts: small trailers that house a bunch of kids who are totally unequipped to deal with everyday life. Leroy lives just down the street from the family that now won't even speak to him. It hurts a lot, seeing families torn, and there's nothing I can do about it but carry on with my life. Leroy was just 15 when he was thrown out of the church and his family. This is the house that I was raised in. That's a 3- story house. We had a mother on each floor. So we had a family of about 30 people. I had been talking to girls and wearing what I wanted and stuff, and that's against the religion, you know? So I came home from work and father came up to me and said,\" The bishop called and he wants you to get your things and leave.\" I said,\" OK, tonight? Like, it's already 6: 00, 7: 00 in the afternoon.\" He was like,\" Yeah.\" So that's what I did. I kind of felt like I died. I wondered how could my parents just let me go into a world that they don't even know. So this kid, who's barely been to school, has never traveled more than a few miles from his home, and has been taught since birth that outsiders are pure evil, is basically given 20 minutes to pack and told to get out forever. On their birthdays, I do my best to call and sometimes I get rejected and told to never call again, but I'm gonna keep it up. Even if they've done their best to forget me, I'm not forgetting them. During our conversation with Leroy, we couldn't help but notice we were being followed. You guys know the story on God's squad, don't you? Once Gentiles are in town, people start following them around for hours and make sure that you're not gonna do anything that's gonna hurt the community. _ _ Even after being out of the church for years, these kids are still afraid of church security. The longer we stayed there, a bunch of things that seemed kind of quiet and quaint when we first arrived, started feeling really creepy. A whole bunch of people turning their backs, running inside, and circling around in pickup trucks. It's Little House on the Prairie mixed with Children of the Corn all being run by a convicted pedophile from a jail cell states away. What the fuck? My honest opinion is I don't think Warren's as bad as he's put out to be. Honestly. I'm grateful that I was raised the way I am, and he hasn't done anything to my family or me to hurt me. But he took your family from you. Yeah, but it was because that's part of the religion. I mean what's religion if it doesn't have standards? Everybody that's been raised in this religion knows that the outside world is a huge, bad, mixed- up place. We kept asking ourselves, how could this possibly happen in America? Is the FLDS a cult? Yes. In my mind, it's a cult. He could seriously tell one one of his loyal followers to go kill somebody, and they'd go do it thinking it was the right thing to do. The problem is we're not just talking about one person here. We're talking about a town full of brainwashed followers. You know, someone such as Warren Jeffs that has control over the community, you have to take very seriously, and I find he's very dangerous because you never know what kind of edict he could come up with out of prison. And with Warren's jail cell orders getting stranger and stranger, it may just turn out that these young men with no families and grim prospects, are far better off in exile. West Africa's Mauritania is one of the poorest countries in the world. On top of that, only. 5% of its land can be used for farming. And on top of that, the country's been suffering from a worsening food crisis for the past few years. So when we heard they're currently experiencing an obesity epidemic and that this epidemic was actually self- inflicted, we sent Thomas there to see what is going on. _ _ Hi. It's Thomas. It's midnight in the Sahara. We're eating, um, camel milk and millet to get fat and beautiful. West Africa has never made any bones about its preference for thick chicks. _ Unfortunately, Mauritania's recurrent famine and general lack of resources make it nearly impossible to pack on the pounds. Never mind the fact that it's smack in the middle of the Sahara, an environment so harsh you basically shed weight any time you're not indoors lying down. The only way for girls out here to meet Mauritanian beauty standards is for their moms to literally force feed them full of milk and food. It's similar to how you make fois gras. In fact, they use the same term for both: gavage. _ _ _ _ Aminetou Mint Ely is an expert on Mauritania's forcefeeding fixation. _ We're going to head out now to the desert, to a Mauritanian fat camp. I'm going to take part and basically going to be drinking several liters of camel milk a day, eating as much millet as I can keep down without barfing. We're at a fish market right now, and I'm trying to find a scale so we can do a little weigh- in to see... kind of get a precise figure on how beautiful they can make me in 2 days. Starting weight: I'm at 55 kilos right now, which I think is a nice weight. I'm going to do 2 or 3 days of gavage and see what that does to me. Doesn't seem like the best place on Earth to be chugging milk, but I guess that's, you know, that's the whole point of it. You gotta suffer for your looks. This is my gavage mate Hanan, a 19- year- old Mauritanian girl who's starting to get serious about landing a husband. We started chitchat over an appetizer of breadcrumbs drenched in olive oil. OK, just go? So basically you take this like a pill and just ball it up and then... _ It's all right. How many times have you done this? _ Did you want to do it or did your mother make you do it? _ _ _ Then we moved on to a light lunch of goat meat, bread, and another bowl of milk to open up the stomach. My first sip of camel milk was a little underwhelming. It seemed especially watered down for what I was expecting, almost like a super skim. Not bad so far, it's like a Mauritanian French dip. It's really a light start. The meat's kind of doing stuff to my head, but other than having like goat fat all over my hands, I feel all right. It just feels like a big meal. So far I didn't get what the big deal was with gavage. It just felt like basic overeating. I mean, my whole country overeats. That night, however, the real feeding began. The camel skim I had gotten used to was replaced with camel cream, warm camel cream. I was starting to process the true nature of gavage, as well as way too much milk. _ _ _ Ah, this is insane. _ I did already. _ _ It feels like the food has filled my entire chest cavity and is now deflating my lungs. I don't know what I was thinking with this. Oh, I do not feel good at all. It's very breathtaking, visually, to wake up to this, but I'm still full of milk despite having pissed like 8 times. I was gonna ask\" What's for breakfast?\" but... There's kind of like a frat hazing element to this. 3, 2, 1. Bravo. Eating wasn't even a chore at this point. It was punishment. I definitely passed the point I would have stopped about 8 bites ago. _ _ _ _ Hurt doesn't begin to cover my personal hell of milk and desert heat. OK, I just puked twice in my mouth. Oh, shit. Oh, God, I really don't feel good... guys. Oh! Ugghh! Now that we were barf buddies, Hanan seemed a lot more sympathetic to me, even though what I'd gone through was only a sliver of the full gavage experience. _ I think that if I did two more days, I'd probably die. The thing is, what we've just been through with Hanan is the voluntary rich girl version of gavage. In some parts of the desert, parents still start forcefeeding their daughters as toddlers and crush their toes with pincers if they resist. Gavage isn't just the desert milk- chugging ritual. Gavage is an entire lifestyle of overeating. You have 2 to 3 lunches daily. You stay inside and try not to move. You don't have a job. If you have daughters when you're married, would you... do you think you would do gavage with them? _ I think it's about time to go back to the scale now and see how much damage two days of this can do to you. So I was 55 before, and I am now 59. It's about 10 pounds, so... I mean, if you multiply that by doing it week after week after week and making it your lifestyle, this is nuts. This is the most insane crash dieting. In a way, fashion and beauty has always been about trying to make yourself the opposite of what you actually are. In the West, rich people dress in torn jeans and try to look like they can't get enough to eat, while our poor leave the tags on their clothes so you know how much they overpaid for them. So why should it be surprising then, in a landscape designed to make you skinny, the best way to boost your image is to slam milk until you are obese. It shouldn't be a surprise. Just a little gross. Wealth disparity in the U. S. has become a very hot topic recently. The 99% versus the 1% became a rallying cry that was adopted almost instantaneously. The growing gap between rich and poor is a global issue, but in the slums of Mumbai, where over 11 million residents live in poverty, the contrast is startling. So I went to India to see just how bad it really is. _ India is home to the highest number of poor people in the world, with over 360 million of its citizens living below the poverty line. And India's largest city, Mumbai, is home to an estimated 22 million people, half of which live in slums. This means that 4 times the population of Chicago is living in absolute squalor. Now contrast this with the fact that Mumbai is also home to the largest and most expensive single- family dwelling on Earth. India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani's billion- dollar personal palace is a 27- story, 400, 000- square- foot skyscraper that takes over 600 employees just to maintain it day to day. And if that's not freaky enough, this futuristic mega- super- mansion actually looks down on some of the worst slums in the world. _- How are you?- Hi.- Good to see you!- Same to you. Where are we right now? _ And how many people live in it? A million people live in this slum. How many people in Mumbai live in slums? _ So, 11 million people living in slums. Can you show us around? _ So, a million people live here. What are their qualities that they live under? _ _ _- Right now, I'm smoking--- You smoke? No, but I'm smoking with you right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We are smoking, yeah. _ How much would it cost to live here? _ _ _ _ _ Right. _ _ _ So they all work there, and they all live there?- Yes. Yeah.- At the same time.- Because they can't pay rent.- Yes. _ But how would you even live in there, though? _ _- Yeah, maybe the world.- Yeah. So there's open sewers everywhere. It smells quite pungent. In fact, it's estimated that there's only one working toilet for every 1, 400 people living in the slum. If TV were scratch- and- sniff, then everyone would be barfing right now. It smells so bad, it's shocking. I don't know what just fell on me, but it's not good. _ _ _ _ _- They make new plastic out of it.- Right. _ Not great, no. So they've got all the shit plastic from all over Mumbai, and they bring it here to the slum, and then they just sort of, by hand, recycle it. Insane. There's no real roads, there's just winding alleyway after winding alleyway, which wouldn't be so bad except there's over a million people that live in this slum. And around every corner, it seemed that there was something even more shocking. There were young kids working in the dark, running makeshift machines that were retooling waste metal. And as we walked around, I realized that the whole economy of Dharavi is based on the garbage of the real economy of Mumbai. Everywhere you looked, people were trying to make something, anything, to sell or trade, desperately trying to make some money out of the waste of the real world. Because it's so wind- y, there's no real roads, we're gonna go up on the roof and see if we can see the slum. I don't know if this is up to safety code. How far does the slum go? It's huge. _ 432- acre slum. Right in the middle of Mumbai. It reminds me of like\" Mad Max\" or something, where they were living off garbage and fixing the garbage. Or, do you remember in\" Star Wars\", do you know when they go down into the garbage? If you jumped in there there'd be like an eye come up and then go after you. So, you have all these people living in the slum, they sleep under their sewing machines. What do they think about a guy has a billion- dollar house? _ _ _ _ Yeah. _ Now, do you think people who live in the building, who are swimming in the swimming pool feel bad when they look down and they see people sleeping in the streets? _ _ _ _ _ _ Yeah, yeah. _ It's too much gap. There's too much gap. After spending some time in Dharavi, we wanted to see how the proverbial 1% live in the skyscrapers that reign these slums. So we hooked up with a textile magnate named Gautam Singhania to show us around Mumbai in his private helicopter. So, how many million people live in Mumbai? _ _ _ _ Gautam is your quintessential 1- percenter playboy, complete with a fleet of yachts, aptly named after James Bond films, massive houses, and, of course, a stable filled with the world's fastest cars. Wow. So this is a Ferrari, I know that much. Yeah, it's the 458 Italia. This was the first 458 that came to India. So you got the first one. Yes. This is an 07 Gallardo, which has been modified. It's got twin turbos. It's fast, trust me. Do you actually ever drive the cars? We drive every weekend. There's a supercar club that we have, and it's a bunch of guys who love cars. When we go in the club with the boys, it's always good to know you have the power under your foot. Sure. Are we gonna go take one on the road? Sure, let's go. And how did you fall in love with cars first? I guess it's in your DNA. Here we go. You get a lot of stares when you drive around the streets of Mumbai? That's why we formed the supercar club you know. The point of the club is that when we guys used to go out, you know, just one of us, two of us, three of us, so many people used to stand and, you know, look. And we just figured that, it's just much easier when we have everybody together. Now, maybe it was because we were driving around Mumbai in a quarter of a million dollar supercar, but Gautam did not seem to want to talk about the obvious disparity of wealth in the city. Now, what do people think about Mukesh's house? _ _ _ And so you're building a house but you don't want to talk about it.- Yeah.- OK, that's OK. Because of the bad publicity that Mukesh Ambani had enjoyed because of his house, Singhania didn't really want to talk about the new home he was building. He did let slip, however, that his personal private skyscraper was actually going to be 10 stories higher than Ambani's and have not one, but two Olympic- sized swimming pools. Mumbai perfectly exemplifies the growing gap between rich and poor, but the problem is actually a global one. Even the old Communist societies of Russia and China, have now morphed into arguably the most capitalist countries in the world. It seems that in our modern age, there are very few places left on earth where the rich aren't getting richer and the poor poorer. When you see it in Mumbai, it's so clear- cut because it's poverty and people living off the garbage of the other society and the other economy. And the other half are building skyscrapers into the sky and living on megayachts and flying into them on helicopters. And you say,\" What's happening to the world?\" Half of the world is living off the garbage of the other half in this post- apocalyptic nightmare", "imdb_url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2891506", "imdb_id": "tt2891506", "year": "2013", "rated ": "TV-MA", "genre": "Documentary, News", "plot": "'Mormon Lost Boys' Young men have been thrown out of their homes because of an edict allowing polygamist church elders to monopolize young girls.

{"title": "Snitch", "content": "No way. Oh, my God. I can't wait to get up there. Two boats, man, that's like two thousand pills. No, I'm good, man. I don't know, bro. I'll talk to you later about it, all right. Hey, why don't you answer the phone? I was Skyping with Craig.- Jason.- Sorry. Hello. Hi, Maggie. No, no, Nick said that the layoffs weren't happening in our division. Mike, I understand, but the bottom line is I need to buy all four rigs. Anything less than that, there's no point. I may as well just keep leasing. Well, that's what they do. Those haulers, they get together once a year, then they raise the rates before the gas prices. They do because they know they can get away with it. See the contract? Yeah, it's real. I just don't know when it's going to start. How much money am I going to have to borrow? All right, let's move some equity around. I've been rolling the dice my whole life, might as well do it again. I gotta go. Solid week, boys, thank you. Figured Analisa would have you putting up ribbons and balloons. I'm still out getting Izzy's cake. Good luck with that. I need it, have a good weekend, Wayne. See you. You know there's no O. T. unless it's authorized. Not looking for O. T., sir, it's got a broken pallet, I'm getting my bags out of the weather, it's going to rain tonight. Good heads up. Sir, I got this, seriously, I don't want you to get dirty. It's all right. Let's do it together. I'm John Matthews. Daniel James. Good to meet you, Daniel. Don't worry about it. How long you been working here? You mean working for you? About three weeks now. Why, you thinkin' about givin' me that raise already? Fat chance, buddy.- You gotta try, right?- Gotta give it a whirl. I have a package for Jason Collins. Yeah, that's me. All right, sign right there. All right, thanks. Have a good one. Thanks, man. Search warrant! DEA! Open the door. DEA! Runner, back fence! Freeze! Get down!- Get on the ground!- Down! Cupcakes. Thank you, that looks so good. I love you. Hi, baby. You having fun on your birthday, Izzy? Hey, Sylvie, hey, let me call you back. I'm... What? They tell you anything? Just to wait here until we're called. They're treating him like he's some kind of major criminal, John. All right, we'll straighten it out. Is he under my last name or yours? You know he changed it to mine. Why are you even asking?- Hi, my son, Jason Collins is...- Take a seat and wait to be called. Can you at least tell me where he is? Have you noticed anything different? Like what? With him, who he's been hanging with, anything out of the ordinary. No, John, I haven't noticed anything. This is such bullshit. I mean, he is a good kid. Mike's sending a lawyer. Good, you can afford it. Didn't you quit? Mr. and Mrs. Matthews? Yeah, thanks for coming. Where's Jason? They're moving him from his holding cell to a courtroom. He's scheduled to be arraigned this evening. That could take a little while. That's all right, leave him in jail for a little bit, scare the hell out of him. No one's trying to scare your son. This is a federal case. The amount of MDMA, or Ecstasy, they found means they've charged Jason with distribution of narcotics. Jason said that a friend asked to have the drugs sent to the house. What friend? A friend by the name of Craig Johnson. That's his best friend. Christ, I have known Craig since he was little. Mr. Johnson was arrested trying to mail the pills, and he agreed to work with the government. What do you mean,\" Agreed to work with the government?\" Both Craig and Jason are being charged under federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws. These laws were designed to ensnare high- level drug traffickers to get them to snitch on other traffickers in order to reduce their own sentence. However, most of the convictions, over half, have been first- time offenders like your son. So Craig is implicating Jason. Yes. In order to reduce his sentence, Craig told the DEA that Jason agreed to have the pills sent to the house and also has agreed to help sell them. What? Now, Jason has denied both of these accusations.- Do you believe him?- Of course I believe him. He would never be involved in anything like this. Are we talking about probation here or could he actually go to jail for this? The mandatory minimum laws are very simple. The amount of jail time depends upon the amount of drugs.- There are no mitigating factors.- What does that mean? Jason is facing a mandatory minimum sentence- of 10 years in prison.- Ten years? Are you out of your mind? He just got accepted to college. John, tell him. Oh, God. Jason. How could they deny him bail? He's never even been arrested before. You want to know the truth? I knew something like this was gonna happen. I figured if I just got him off to college, but no. Jason has no goddamn idea what real responsibility means. Especially with Sylvie babying him all the time. And when your own son doesn't want to have anything to do with you anymore...- That's not true.- That's not true. That's not true at all. It's just really hard for kids who go through divorces. It was, I acted out when my father left. Yeah, well, he's not a kid anymore. Not while he's sitting in that cell. Are the sprinklers on? Does everything have to go to shit? Here's the situation. It's very simple. You help them make trafficking arrests, and they will reduce your sentence from 10 years to two. One suspended. I told you, I don't know anyone else. Just Craig. Bullshit. Your mom told me she smelled marijuana on you before. Where'd you get that from, huh? Jason, this is serious. Come on, honey, you gotta tell us who sold you the pot. I didn't... I didn't have to buy it. Amanda's dad grows it. He has a medicinal license. It's legal. We just took some. I just wanted to try it. Okay, are there any of your friends who do drugs who might be interested in selling? What, like setting someone up? Like Craig did to me? No way. No way. You better wake up. You better wake up right now' cause this is really happening. You're gonna take that plea, and you're gonna help them make the arrest. You hear me? I'll take my chances in court. No, you won't. No, you won't. You do not work with the prosecutors, and they can raise the minimum limit to 30 years. Which means you'll be out in time for your 50th birthday. And they are batting over 90% on convictions. Oh, God, Jason, baby, please, listen to him. We don't have another choice. I'm not setting anyone up. Baby, please. I'm not doing it. I won't do it. Yes, you are. Listen to me, damn it! You think you know what you're doing? You have no idea until you spend the next 10 years of your life in prison. I'm not gonna let that happen to you, son. You hear me? You're not the one who'd have to do it. Morning, John, hey, I need to show you something. This is... Well, they're beauts, ain't they? They said the other two will be ready next month. Yeah, they're great. I gotta make a call. Terry. John Matthews. Good. No, we definitely gotta get out. We'll hit a few. Very soon. Hey, let me ask you something. Do you have a connection to Joanne Keeghan? The U. S. Attorney downtown? Go ahead and have a seat. Mr. Matthews. You have a lot of friends in this city. I received four phone calls in the matter of an hour. I'm sure you'd do the same for your kids. I don't have any children. All right, well, let's see. Eighteen years old. Well, you must have had him when you were quite young. Sophomore in college. Me and his mom were high school sweethearts. Well, you have my sympathies. But I believe in the mandatory minimum laws. We're fighting a war right now not just on drugs, but on the violence they bring. And we are losing badly, so it's time for all our sakes we have to turn this around. Miss Keeghan, I agree. I do. But my son, Jason, he's not a drug dealer. He's a good kid, and he just made a really dumb, naive mistake. And he's willing to do anything he can to help out his situation. But the only drug dealer that he knows is Craig Johnson who you already have in custody. Well, I'm really sorry to hear that. Please, there's gotta be something I can do. Well, now the laws are designed to preclude any special circumstances so it's really quite simple. We need your son to help us make arrests before we can help him reduce his sentence. If he can't do that or isn't willing to do that, then there's really nothing we can do. I'm sorry. And now, I have to be somewhere else.- What if I did it for him?- What? What if I helped you make arrests? It's not the way it works. Please. I just want to help my son. I understand. And I really am sorry, but my hands are tied. There's nothing I can do. Thank you for stopping by. How you doing? Hi. Who are you here to see? Jason Collins. Okay. Just sign in. Proceed to booth 3. Thank you. Got your punk ass in here, too. Yeah, I see him. What happened? Nothing. Tell me. It's okay. Talk to me, son. It's okay. Tell me. Remember when someone kept teepeeing and egging your house? That was me. I would sit around the corner and laugh and watch you try and clean it off. Doesn't matter now, Jason. The last time I did it, I didn't know you were out of town. I felt like crap watching Analisa just do it herself. So I pretended I was just stopping by. I helped her. She told me. I hated that you got to live in that big house. New family. Me and Mom were just stuck in that old one. I wanted you to live with me. I wanted you in my life. It was my fault. Not yours. I was always gone. I was always on those trucks. I was always working. I got so caught up in not failing you as a father, that's exactly what I did. I should've never taken that package. I knew what was in it. I should've just told the guy he had the wrong address. But I didn't. Because me and Amanda wanted to try some. But I swear to you, Dad, I would never ever. I wasn't planning on helping to sell that stuff. I'm not a drug dealer. You believe me, right? Of course I believe you. And I know I should be punished for what I did. But not like this. Jason, don't cry. Don't cry, Jason. Not in here. Listen to me, Jason. You gotta show them you're gonna stand up for yourself in here. You have to. I promise you I'm gonna get you out of here. How? You just gotta trust me. I love you.- What you want?- Coke. Crack is whack, man. Who do you think we are, dude? I'll just go to somebody else. Look, man. If you real about it, money talks. Get off me! Get him, man. Hey, let's jack this bitch's ride, too! Here come the rollers! I know. I'm sorry I threw your name down at the station. Your son is not gonna be better off if you're dead. Okay, well, clearly what I did last night didn't work. Clearly. Please. What do I gotta do? You are so stubborn, you're not gonna stop, are you? No. I'm not. All right, hypothetically, I would need an airtight arrest of someone in possession of narcotics in the amount that would constitute conspiracy to distribute. If we're talking cocaine, that would be at least 500 grams or half a kilo. What? I'm in the construction business. And we have ex cons who are working the yard all the time. Maybe someone knows someone who knows someone. You're their boss. Why would they trust you? Let me worry about that. Believe me, I am not worried because the risk is all yours. Come on. I'll give you a lift. Thank you. But I'm good. Hey, I'm the boss. Get in. How's the job treating you? The fact that I got a job. Look, I guess I'm just trying to say thank you. Me and my family, we appreciate the opportunity, so... I mean, it's gotta be hard for a... Ex con. So that... That's why we're here? You need to talk to me about my past?' Cause look, I was completely honest on my application, but if there's anything else... No. That... That's not it. Okay. Couple of years ago, I caught two of my drivers, they were transporting some stuff. They know that the cops rarely stop semis, and if they did, they sure as hell didn't have time to search'em. Anyway, that was small time. I was hoping that someone with a connection into that world... Are you accusing me of something, sir? You think I've done something? No. No, no, no, no, no, no. With all due respect, sir, why don't you just go ahead and tell me what it is that you want from me? An introduction. Yeah, I can't help you with that. You get me in front of the right people, I give you five grand. Something good comes out of it, I'll give you another five. That's 10... You know, I can count, man, I can count. Like I said, I can't help you with that. Why not? You see, John, I'm in the middle of trying to get my life in order, okay? And I'm doing that for my family. That's why I work like I do. That's why I sweat my ass off every day in that yard. This little conversation, just this would, see, his could be seen as conspiracy, all right? And that gets me 25... To life. I would... I'd appreciate it if maybe we just pretend that this never happened, okay? I'll see you at work, sir. I just need an introduction. I think you oughta go home, and you oughta be happy for what you got. Thank you for the coffee. Daniel! Twenty grand. I'll double it because of the risk you're taking. So right there? That's where you're staying? Right up there. Anthony. Anthony. Why don't you go inside? Go on. Go inside. Come on, Dad. I'm just hanging. Go. Now. Go. Go on. Why you checkin' on peewee for? Hold up, man. Hold... Hold, hold, hold up. I don't care if y'all sling what you sling. Y'all smoke what you smoke. You can blow holes in each other if that's what you want, but I'm gonna tell you right now, you're gonna stay away from my son,- you hear me? You hear me?- All right. All right. What are you, stupid, Flaco? Hey. Dad, why did you... Anthony. Go play your game. All right, what happened? Nothing happened, V. Just father and son stuff. What are you doing? Going to work. What do you mean, work? Larry called, told me I have to be there in an hour. Come on, V, he can't do that. He can't just call you 7: 30 at night- and tell you to come to work.- He can do whatever he wants, Daniel. That is, if I want to keep my job. Look, I'm already late. There's food for both of you on the stove. What are you doing, babe? Listen, wait, wait, wait. Let me ask you something. Let me run something by you. What if me and my little partner over there, before bed time, we cruise to the office? We charm your guests. Fatten up them tips. Make it work for everybody, you know what I'm saying? I'd like that. Yeah? Okay, I have to go. Don't go to work. Don't go to work.- I love you.- I love you. I love you. Hey, A, get on the couch, man. Sit down, bud. Why did we move here, man? We moved so you wouldn't have to hang out with fools like that. That's why. Right? There ain't nobody else to hang with around here. I want to go back to our old apartment. You know we can't, so don't say it. Look, man. I know it's hard. And sometimes life is. But I promise you, one day, we're gonna move somewhere, and you're gonna get real friends. A real friend. You ain't gotta prove nothing to him. You ain't gotta do nothing for him. But those punks out there, man, you're better than that. Want me to tell you something else? You better than me, man. You're so much better than me.- Hey.- Yeah. What's a shot caller? Where'd you hear that? Don't worry about that. I love you, man. And I'm proud of you. You need to be smart. Go get your homework, man. We're gonna bang it out. Just keep going, man. All the way to the end. Don't stop.- Right here?- You're good. I need to go on alone first. This guy in here, Malik. If he sniffs you even a little bit full of shit, I'm gonna tell you right now, man, you're never gonna leave this block. That's a promise. All right. What up, Cruizer? What up, Malik? Been a while since I seen yo ass. What house you was in last? I was up at Sandstone, man. That's right. It was cold as hell up there, wasn't it, cuz? That's the truth, man. Boy, me and ol' boy right here, we used to get it in. Movin' product like we was the United Nations and shit.' Cause you know when it comes to that paper... Only color that matters is green. So how long you been home, man? You just now come to see me? Come on, Malik. You know I can't be associating with no known- ass criminals now. I hear you. That's why I be in here. Two strikers like us, man, we can't walk the street. No, man. It ain't safe. So I'm saying though, you back in the game, right? How come you ain't cross town with your homeys? Just can't have any of the old homeys getting any bright ideas, man. I'm telling you, them days, they over for me, Malik. That's it. Right here is a one timer. Real smart, cuz. Real smart. Keep that bank to yourself. Yo, homey, kill the beat. I'm John Matthews. Now, see, that's the reaction I was looking for, playa. Ain't never had no iron in your grill before, huh? Now see, if you was the popo, then you'd be the biggest pussy pig I ever seen. Now let's have an honest conversation as to why you in my crib. I don't have product or distribution. But I do know business. If anyone needed transportation, I could provide that with no risk. There's always risk. My way minimizes it. See, what I want to know is why a successful businessman like yourself want to take any risk at all. I'm in the construction business. The way the economy is today, it's all gone to shit. And I don't see any chance of it coming back. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to keep my business afloat. I've worked too hard for too long. So how much weight can you move? My trucks, half a ton without attracting attention. Half a ton? Man, if I was in the thousand- pound business, I wouldn't be sitting in this dump right now. AII I'm saying is, whatever you want to move, it won't matter in my trucks. You know they weigh them trucks at the state lines though, right? How you gonna cover that? We offset the weight. Count's off all the time. The police get lucky, they'll only get the driver. We won't be there for the loading or unloading. Sound like he ready for the game. So what you talking, playa? 15% wholesale. I don't give nobody over 10%. I know I got something to prove to you. If the first run goes good, then we renegotiate. You gonna drive the first load. Everybody know what game Malik in. We need to see if you for real first. Then maybe, just maybe, we go back to talking. Done. Go and chill outside for a minute. Let me and my boy Cruizer here have a word. You gonna ride shotgun. No, no, no, no, Malik. Maybe you misunderstood- why I'm here.- Misunderstood? Yeah, maybe you misunderstood. I'm here for an introduction, Malik. Hell no, Cruizer. See you wouldn't be vouching for no fish if we was back in the yard. You know how this work. We ain't talking no hold time, homey. We in the street! That's three strikes, bruh. And the third strike for me is the third strike for you, my man. So you better be convincing me right now, or he's smoke. And we can act like none of this never happened. It's your call, man. For this first round, I'm gonna be going with you. But we do it my way. I say how it goes.- What do you mean?- I wanna get paid today. Okay? So I don't know if we have to go see your banker. I don't care, man, go rob a store. But I need to get paid. Don't worry. You'll get your 10 grand. No 10 grand, man. We said 20 grand. That's what you said to me. And then what? You skip town on me? With all the money? So you coming with me on this first run, that's fine. The moment it's done, you'll get your other 10. My word. Your word? Only reason this is going down is because I went on the line for you. Three days ago, man, I was working a job, I was staying clean. I was doing everything I was supposed to do, and now here I am. I'm back in. Think this is some kind of thrill for me? Would you just please take me to my money? Y'all checked him out with them niggas in Sandstone. They sayin' Cruizer's solid. He's on the main line like he said. Soldiering up. Putting in work like good wood should. Even had keys to the yard for a minute. That's the Cruizer I know. What about our other player? Bones say he live in the suburbs. Fat crib with a wife, little girl, he ain't 5- 0, that's for sure. He better not be. Because he on us with El Topo. No, the new TV spots are testing really well with your core. Then why am I down by five points? Because the liberals think you're a bitch. Maybe I should go to a gay wedding.- It wouldn't hurt.- Please. Listen, we had 900 convictions last year alone. They speak volumes to our core, right? But to win this primary, the key to this primary is getting some crossover votes. Your next meeting is checking in down in security.- Who is it?- John Matthews. I'll need a coffee. Let's go over her press schedules. So I looked at it as a business thing. What do I have that they want? I'm impressed. You're a natural. You're lucky he didn't rip you open, man. He's a heavy hitter. Runs the entire Adams district now. What's his jacket? He earned his stripes on the corner as a punk ass kid, did a nickel for ADW. Three more for distribution. Rivals robbed his bank last year. Instead of sending out his posse to do a drive by, he tracked them each down and bled them out with a buck knife. Personally. All right. I'm signing off. Cooper is my witness. We arrest Mr. Anderson, and I will reduce Jake's sentence. Jason. Right, sorry, Jason's sentence. By how much? I'll cut it to a year. Come on, I can't let him get off scot- free. And with the time that he's already served, Jason will probably be out in six months. That is the best that I can do.- Okay.- All right. Rock and roll. Is she going to keep her word? Don't give her a reason not to. I like stuffing. Hi, Daddy. Hey, honey. How long are you going away for? Just two days. That's it. Do you know how much I love you, Miss Izzy? All right. Come here. Are you sure you have to go now? You know, with everything going on with Jason? Yeah, we need the contract. Especially after those new trucks we bought. Come on, Iz. Let's go. We gotta go to school. I want you to finish. Have your toast.- Hey.- Hey. You getting ready to go out on one of those trucks? Yeah. How long you going for? Shit, I don't even know where we're going to. It's a good thing your boss is giving you more responsibility. Means he believes in you. I'm proud of you.- You proud of me?- Yeah. That is a good thing. I love you, too. Come here. Wires in the semi are in place. We'll do the same to the warehouse once you're gone. I know you've done this before. Undercover. Do you have any advice? Just be yourself, John. Try to be something you're not, their bloodhounds will smell it right away. You're a family man, you're trying to stay afloat. You got means they could use. That's it. You hide in plain sight and you just keep doing what you're doing. And they'll believe it because it's the truth. All right. Audio's up. Here we go. Truck's GPS is on his tail. Right? You got it. I'm here. Where we going? El Paso. Right by the border. That's over a thousand miles. What'd you think? We were just going around the corner? If you don't mind me asking, how long were you in prison for? Just a little over a nickel total. You never told me if you had kids. What are you doing, man? Just don't do that. You don't need to ask me about my life, all right? And I won't ask you about yours. Let's just... Guy said we're about 150 miles out. I got it, Daniel. I got it. I got it. Shit. No, no. Come on, we gotta get this thing moving! We can't! We can't! Check my right!- Check my right!- You're good, you're good, you're good! Stop, stop. Keep moving! Go! Go! Go! John, where are you going? Shit. Matthews left in the semi hitting Torres' ride in the process.- Is Torres mobile?- Negative. We got local PDs responding to shots fired. Tell Torres to supersede PD. No one sets foot in that yard. No one tips off Malik's suppliers. Torres, talk to me. Let's go. Let's go! What the hell was that? I don't know, man. We gotta hide this thing. No, we gotta get back on the interstate. Public. Moving. Your driver... He has fortitude. He handled the situation very well. We will use that. Smoked every one of them busters. They out back digging ditches right now. Who tried to jack'em? Man, I don't even care, nigga. AII I care about is El Topo loving them trucks. Gonna take our game to a whole nother level.- You hear?- Yeah. All right, everybody, get live. All right, we here. Black Yukon's on Worth and 4th. Put the work in the back of your boy's truck and follow it. Malik, you know that had nothing to do with us, man. Man, just handle business and get there, homey. He's changing up the meet. Said he wants us to put it in your pickup. All right. There's a hidden compartment behind the back seat. Where are you going? Take a leak. Yeah. Tell me you got a wire in that truck. In the dash in the back. Sims, get that needle on two. I need Raven One over at the following location. Who'd you call, John? I asked you a question. Who'd you call, man? My wife. Your wife. You expect me to believe that, man? Why don't you go ahead and grab that beam for me, man. When I say grab that beam, turn your ass around and grab that beam. You want to play me, man? John, you need to know that if this comes down to either you or me, I will take your life. I will shoot you where you stand, do you understand me? Now I'm gonna ask you one last time. Who did you call? My wife. You want to bullshit me, man? It was my wife! It was my wife. Daniel, it was my wife! Come on, man, don't you lie to me! That's the truth! You have a cell phone in your truck. Why didn't you use it? I wanted her to see the caller ID from the warehouse so she believes that I'm working my ass off to save the company. That's the truth. You did this. You did this. Lay back. Go on and flash your lights. All right, right here. Let's just let them get out first, all right? I want to make it easy on him in case he got other plans. Like what? Shootin' our asses so he ain't gotta pay. All right. We good. We'll take them on the way out. Welcome to the real party, player. Heard it cracked off early. I'm here. Go on, man. Let me see one, man. Taste. I'm good. I ain't asking. Get up on you quick, huh? Here's 10 Gs of key. You're welcome. I have visual confirm of the exchange. Just hold until my signal. I'II let you know. Glad to be back in the yard, eh, Cruizer? He's heading toward the exit. What do you want to do? Let them go. Repeat. Let them go. All right, John, let's go, man. We're done. Let's get out of here, man. Let's go. What are you looking at, man? Just making sure they're gone. They're gone, they... What's with you? The stuff I took. That's it. Let's go. It's 11: 00. I thought you were coming home for dinner. Where were you? I was at work. No, there's something going on. We're supposed to be an open book, remember? Is this about Jason? Please talk to me. I have no idea what's going on. If I help them make arrests, they'll reduce Jason's sentence. Okay, how? How are you supposed to help them? By doing a drug deal. Are you out of your mind? You wanted to know.- People get shot and killed!- I know that, Analisa. This is my son!- You have more than one child, John!- And I'd do the same thing for her! You know that. But it is not my rules, okay? It's their rules. Which means every move that I make or I don't make, Jason will have to live with for the next 10 years of his life. And what if you don't live? Baby, have you thought about that? You have a family here, too. And I hope that I have your support when the time comes. You're not old enough to vote though, are you? John, my secretary said you needed to see me. You said all we needed was Malik and the drugs in the same place. That's exactly what we had last night. We had a deal. We had it done.- Calm down!- Don't tell me to calm down! I'm not gonna keep my voice down! He had 10 keys and he let him go! This is my kid's life, God damn it!- Keep your voice down! Stop it!- It's not just about you! Malik's supplier's gonna be at the next exchange. Cooper made the call, and it was the right one. You go for the highest target, John. Now you just have to be patient. Take the next meeting. Your son will be all right. Great. You had Malik single handed with 10 keys and you let him go? He would've given up everybody. Oh, bullshit, he would've. I had to make a judgment call. No, you didn't. It is my call. And I will decide exactly how this comes down, do you understand? Is that clear? Crystal. Hey, Sylvie. And do what? I came to visit Jason. They wouldn't let me see him. They said he was in the infirmary. What happened? He was assaulted. They said he had over 36 stitches. When they say\" assaulted\"... I don't know, they said that they were gonna keep him in there for at least two more days and that there was no way that you and I could even see him. I'm trying here, right? I talked to the lawyers at Project Innocence, and they said that they were gonna... He's not going to last that long, Sylvie. I don't see you getting anywhere! Oh, God. Damn it, I did this to him. I did it. God damn it.- No, you didn't.- I did. I should... I should've known, I should've known he was in trouble. I should've been able to protect him. Please, John. Let's end this nightmare. It's not your fault. John. What's going on? Did you follow me here? Who'd you visit? It's my son. Look, man, he made a mistake, his friend set him up. Wait, wait... They said if we cooperate, if we help them... You made a deal. Geez, you got any idea what they're gonna do to us, man? You have any idea?- It ain't just Malik, man. It's the cartel, man.- You know what they're gonna do- to our families, man?- It's my son. Your son? What about my son, man? I've got a son, John. You're a dead man, John. You're a dead man. Hey, where's your mom? She's sleeping. Vanessa, what are you doing? Is this what you've been doing on your work trip, huh? Can't even take care of your own goddamn son! Stop, Vanessa, he's in the other room. Look, it's not what you think, okay? Listen to me. It is not what you think. Bullshit! You made me a promise, Daniel. Baby, listen. I need you to pack a bag. I stay clean and you stay away from- that life, remember?- Baby... I understand, baby. But right now, what I need you to do is I need you to pack a bag for you and Anthony. You need to go stay with your mom. You don't tell me what to do. Not after last night! All right, enough! Okay, just... Look, I'm, I'm... I'm in trouble, baby. I am in trouble. Okay. Please don't do that, Vanessa. Sweetheart, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, look, it's nothing that I can't... I can't do it again, Daniel, I can't do it again. I can't watch you go to prison or... Or end up dead. Baby, that is not gonna happen, do you hear me? That is not gonna happen. I'm not going anywhere, sweetie. Why do you do this to us? Why do you keep doing this? I can't, I can't, I can't! I'm sorry. Oh, shit.- They just came right in.- Where's Isabelle? She's still at school. Get her and take her to your sister's now. Go! Go! What are you doing here, Malik? I like your old lady. She in a hurry, huh? What do you want? You want that paper, right? What about Daniel? What about him? Come on, man, El Topo waitin'. Only him. Arms up. You have a cell phone? Yeah. It no longer works. And anything else on you electronic. I understand your business is in a complicated spot. Pretty hard to make money nowadays. It doesn't have to be. When you work for us, you will be treated like family. This of course includes your wife. And your child. I hear Isabelle is a beautiful girl. You and Analisa are really lucky to have her. Thank you. You will make this next trip alone. Once you make the pickup, you will take it into Mexico. We will unload your construction supplies as well before you cross back over the border so everything looks legitimate. Palacio will pay you$250, 000. If all goes well, you will see much more. Show us your loyalty and your future will be bright, my friend. I will call you the day after tomorrow, 10: 00 a. m., with an address. Be ready to leave. What about Malik? You work for us now. Let's get one thing clear, man, you still works for me. Got it. Just handle your business, playa.' Cause I ain't lettin' nobody get in the way of me and my bread. John, are you okay? Are you at Gabby's yet? I'm, like, 30 minutes. You can't go there now. Why? No, goddamn it, tell me now. What is happening? Is my sister in danger? Mommy? They knew my wife and kid's name, damn it.- What if they know about Jason?- They don't. How the hell do you know that? Because from the moment we started this operation, we logged you separately into NTlS. What is NTlS? It's a Fed database. Anyone who logs into your case file, runs your name or Jason's, they notify me. They ran your name yesterday at noon. That's why they know about Analisa and Isabelle.- And not Jason?- No, because he's listed under his mother's maiden name, and you don't have the same address. He's safe. Who'd you meet with? Malik called him\" El Topo.\"- Who is he?- He's Juan Carlos Pintera. They call him\" The Mole.\" El Topo. He's ex Mexican paramilitary, and he runs this region for the Nuevo Le\u00c3\u00b3n cartel. That's who he is. Getting Pintera would seriously cripple their organization. What did he say about the run? Just that there was another pickup. And I gotta take it into Mexico. What, into Mexico? Why? Because that means you're running their money this time. You see, John, one of the ways that we're fighting the cartel is to stop them getting their profits. Right now, it's virtually impossible for them to wire money in, so they have to physically transport it. Hundreds of millions of dollars. This could be an incredible opportunity for us. Especially if we got Pintera, too. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure. John, would you excuse us for a second? I'd appreciate it. Thanks.- What?- You know damn well what. El Topo's a game changer, and he's way out of his depth. Are you kidding me? We can still bring in Malik.- No, no, no.- We can squeeze him for a third strike... We get... There's no way El Topo's gonna be at that exchange tomorrow. I am not missing this opportunity. Even if we don't get him, you know the way this works. You follow the drugs, you get players. You follow the money...- Yeah...- You get a kingpin. Yeah, you know that if he crosses that border, he's never coming back. You good with that? John? Sit down. Drink? No.- Coffee?- No. Look, we had a deal. I deliver Malik to you, you reduce my son's sentence to a year. I'm really sorry, but we are way past Malik now. If we pick him up, we're going to tip off the cartel. And what if I go to a judge? You can if you want to, but with the mandatory minimum laws, a judge has no say to reduce the sentence. Only the federal prosecutor does. And that's me. Look, this is the last stop. You've been very patient. I give you my word. Your son is coming home soon. Immediately. Excuse me? I go through with this, Jason comes home that instant. Then I'll make sure that every parent out there knows how compassionate you've been to my son. Okay. You complete this, and I will have the judge release your son. But I need the money, and the arrest of a cartel player. Nothing less. Hey, John. What time are they calling you with the pickup address? 10: 30 tomorrow morning. The reason they pick Sunday, it's a high traffic day at the border. Less inspections. You don't think this is a good idea, do you? Hey, man, don't matter what I think. You made a deal with the dragon lady. Not me. John, you gotta know there's a reason they picked you so quick for this run. Cartels don't use their own people to carry loads. They recruit. Guys like you... Favorite target is a middle- class kid in a school. Make it sound all exciting to carry a backpack full of dope for pockets full of cash. And then they do it. These guys threaten to kill their families. They use them, they abuse them. They end up in a barrel full of acid. That's it, they're gone. Done. Easy come, easy go. Because there's always gonna be another mule to take their place. Brother, you gotta know, this is one serious backpack you're about to carry. Hello. I'm here to see my son. He should be out of the infirmary. Is he under\" Matthews\"? Jason Collins. Okay. Just sign in.- Go to window 4.- All right. Thank you. Are you okay? I'm fine. God damn it. I can't keep letting this happen to you. They say anything about moving you? How is everybody? How's Izzy? She doing all right? I've been wanting to tell you something. I admire you so much. The stand you're taking. You didn't take the easy way out. Not setting up one of your friends. I couldn't do what you did. So it looks like you're the one teaching me what real character and integrity is all about. I love you, son. I love you, too. Who is it? It's John. What are you doing here, man? I'm parked a few blocks away just in case somebody's watching. Daniel, thank you for not ratting me out. Believe me, man, I thought about it. If I don't go through with this, they're not gonna release my son. But you don't understand, man, you play nice with the feds, man, but what happens when Malik and everyone finds out you're an informant? What happens to me? That puts me right with you. They know I'm a rat. They will hunt us down, man. They will... They're gonna come after our families, John. Daniel, I know I'm the one who put us all in this danger. And I gotta live with that. There is no way that I'm gonna let either side dictate our fates. No way. Yeah, I know the area. It's gonna take about an hour and a half to get there. Well, it's still gonna take 90 minutes in a semi. Both wires loud and clear. Our guy's 12 miles out. He's been sitting there 15 minutes. What's he doing? Shit. All right. Let's do a drive by. Shit. Anybody hear anything? Voices? Struggle? Where the hell are you, John? What took you so long? Just lost the DEA. We're on. Hey, John. You're sure you can pull this off, right? Not without your part, no. I need that number. All right. We counted every dollar. You will be responsible for it. We can't track him by the cell. Maybe it's turned off. Why would he ditch us? What's the address in Mexico? Get to El Paso, to the main border crossing. I will tell you which lane. Only you are going to be in the truck to avoid suspicion. We're gonna follow in the cars. Once you cross, our people in Ju\u00e1rez, they're gonna direct you to the final stop. All right. Like them yard tactics, homey. Straight bum rush. That's the Cruizer I know. I need a number on El Topo, bruh. Yo, Malik, you want me to call 911? Man, me and you both know they already on their way. if I cross into Mexico, I'm a dead man. So you think you're better off going alone? Despite what you might think of me, John, I am your only protection on this. Yeah, maybe so. But as many times as you guys changed the game on me, I had to put some things into play first. Yeah, like what exactly? You know my deal with Keeghan was for the money and the bust. Well, now I'm gonna make sure that that happens on this side of the border. I want you to track the cell number that I'm on. I'm in one of my other trucks right now, and it's filled with their cash. John, listen to me, I just got a hit on NTlS. Pull over now. They know. Get Jason in protective custody. Don't you worry about him. We're on it. We got units coming to him now. Already got the prison on lockdown. He's in an isolation cell. It's 517- 555- 0199. It's El Topo's cell. Get me that number track now! Did you get him? Yeah, we locked his position off his cell. I have tactical teams en route. I'm shot. In the leg. John, listen to me. Hang in there. I got units responding to you now.- Clear.- Kitchen clear. House is all clear. Just missed him. Turn around. He's heading north on Nichols. Seal the perimeter. All right, show me hands! Show the hands now! No, no, no, no. Get me your hands in the air! Shut it off! Keep'em up! So you going to vote for her?

We're just gonna disappear on our own. So what did you need me to do, a statement, right? That's why I'm here? You can start by signing that. Wait a second, man. What is that? Listen, you got nothing to worry about, Daniel. We know you were instrumental in this bust. Hundred Gs? Yeah. That's reward money for the capture of Juan Carlos Pintera.

Let's go. Daddy, where're we going? I don't know. Fuck. You're driving too fast.- Daddy, you're driving too...- Shut up! Sorry, excuse me.- Hey, buddy, you want to get behind the tape?- I'm family. I'm Lucas Desange. You called me. Someone called me. Detective or something?- You live here?- No, my brother lives here. What's going on? Where is Jeff? Are the girls okay? Where are the girls? Sir, just hang on, all right? Just wait here. Jesus Christ. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. Daddy, are we there yet? My glasses are broken. What is it? It's okay. Helvetia- It's all right, come here.- There's someone inside. Now! Come on, come on.. Daddy, there's a woman outside. She's not touching the floor. Why are you crying? Because I'm sad, honey. Why are you sad? You know, Mom and Dad, they...... tried real hard. But sometimes they messed things up. You know Daddy loves you, right? I can't see. What's that? Look honey, there.. Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? Look, Lilly. A cherry. Five Years Later. Burnsie, where are you guys, then? Well... We're going to to have a another look around sector 1- 7- 12- 33.- That's the mountain road, right?- Uhuh. Gas station, Road to the Paulson Pass.. The last payment didn't clear.\" Not Pregnant\" Thank you, God. Sweet!- That was Burnside on the phone?- Yup. What is his next move? Is he going to search sector lousy alpha? Hey, guess who's not pregnant? What is wrong with you? Last payment didn't clear. Is there a problem with the bank, or... The money's gone.- I pick B.- That is the correct answer. Look, babe.. It's your brother. You want to spend all your money, and find them, It's okay with me. It's cheaper than therapy.- And so am I.- What..? I need to go.- Burnside!- What? Hey, Burnside! Jesus Christ!- You're going to call him?- Just give me a minute. But we should call, we said we'd call. Ronny, Shut up. Just for one minute. Here you go, Bird. Take a whiff of that. Hello? Ah, yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir. It's cherry pits. Hey, Burnsie! Burnsie, Can we call him now? They found them.- You shitting me.- They found the girls. Alive. Dr. Gerald Defuses.- And you must be Annabel.- I must be.- Lucas.- How are they? Well, just let me warn you. This won't be easy. We're very fortunate, that Victoria was old enough...... to retain much of her vocabulary. But it's still too early to determine...-... if this development...- What about the other one? That's a different story. Shit. Oh, yeah. Hey, Victoria. Is that you, Lilly? Hey... No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you. It's okay. It's okay. I brought something for you. For your eyes. When you were a little girl. You had a pair of these. You remember? I was going to put... That's okay. Just going to put them here. It's okay. Yeah. That's it. Daddy? Oh, no, no, honey. Honey, no, I'm not your Daddy. I'm... I'm your Daddy's brother. Remember Uncle Luke? Dad? It's okay.- Dad?- It's okay. Dr. Gerald Defuses, Your Honour. The girls have been in my care at the Institute. Since they were found 87 days ago. And how would you define their progress? Solid, and outstandingly fast. If I may? A parent figure, to feed them, Sing to them, protect them. They called her:\" Mama\". Victoria and Lilly have a real chance...... to have a normal life, though. With the right care, Physical emotional development. And much needed love and affection.- They'll get better.- Thank you, Dr. Defuses. Ms. Podolski. Would you care to address the Court? Good morning, Your Honour. Jeffrey Desange murdered my niece. And abandoned his daughters in the forest. And now his brother did an extraordinary thing. Lucas never gave up on his nieces. But he did it for the girls. Not for himself. So, if he still has their best interest at heart, He must know neither his salary, nor his very small apartment...... are suitable for the raising of 2 children. Let alone, 2 children with a very special needs.- How many kid did you raise, Jean?- Not as many as you, Lucas. Of cause she wants the girls, Lucas. Stand on her shoes first. She can't just sweep in, and take them. They are not hers to take.- I'm sure that's not entirely fair.- I'll tell you, what's not fair: It's not fair is she gets to buy my nieces.- Is that really such a bad thing?- What? Annabel plays in the band. You draw pictures for a living. Where do you live? Do you have room for children in your life? I mean, really. What are you saying, Gerald? When it comes to the girls' welfare.. Family Court judge is pretty much oblige to act on my recommendation. And right now, I'll be lying if I didn't say it was a slam dunk for Ms. Podolski. But the truth is... I don't want them living on the other side of the country anymore than you do. So... We can really really help each other out right now. You want the girls, I need continued access to them. What are we going to do? This house, courtesy of the Institute, is used for case studies. Rent- free. You move to the house, you get the girls. This is a joke, right? Oh, son of a bitch.- Look, Jean..- No. I just want to see them. That's all. You'll see them. I mean, you've got visitation, right? We respect that. Right now, we need a little space. Just work on this thing for a while. Find their feet.- Okay?- Excuse me. Okay, Victoria. Are you nice and relax? Are you feeling sleepy? I want you to tell me the story again. Can you tell me the story? It was long time ago, A lady run away from hospital for sad people. She took her baby. She jumped into the water. How could you know that story, Victoria? Did Mama tell you that story?- She showed me.- How? In a dream. Go on, Victoria. And you can't tell anyone where you are? Nope. That's just bizarre, dude. Yeah, well. For the girls. Few breaths away. So much deplorable. All families are the messed up. Yeah, but this one messed up, and it ends it. I don't even have the chance to screw them up. They came that way.- Leave him.- I can't. You don't sign up for this, babe. I can't do that to him. Mrs. Sensitivity, You are in a rock band. I was in a rock band, yeah. Hey, girls. Hey. Come here. Mama. No, don't call me that. I'm not your Mom. I'm Annabel. You can call me that. Or Annie, or whatever you like. We could... We could work it out together, right? Mama. Handsome? CLlFTON FORGE PUBLlC RECORDS. There are no police reports between 2008 and 2012...... that match the patient's story. And Doctor, there are no psychiatric hospitals...... anywhere near Clifton Forge. Where were the closest one would be? Falls Church, 200 miles from here. Now this log book, contains records from St. Kerch\u2019 s asylum. Abided to Salt Lake. That's 5 miles north from here. But you told me that there are no mental hospitals in the area. There aren't. St. Kerch is shut down in 1878. Page 31. Patient Edith Brennan.- Annabel?- Yup?- Handsome is outside.- Try to put him there. But he's crying. Awesome. There's no way these kids are ready for this. I know it's tough. It'll get better. I promise. I don't know if I can do this, Luc. I love you, girl.- Someone's here!- What? Victoria, Lilly?- No one's here.- Someone's here. I saw them.- Wow, wow, honey, honey.- I saw them. Give me the hammer. I'll check downstairs. You look after the girls. Lucas? Oh my God. Chop, chop. Chop, cop. I'm really sorry, Annabel. But they told me he responded well to the tests. And it's uh, very likely this coma is temporary. What happens now? I'm afraid I don't follow.- Those girls now without Lucas...- No. Annabel, the girls need you. They need security, Protectability. But I'm not prepared for this.- I can't do this alone. This is not my job to do.- Just... Just follow, if you not, you'll lose custody. And Lucas will be lucky if he sees his nieces every second at Thanksgiving. Well, I checked out. All the doors and windows are locked. No evidence of intruder. Nothing's stolen. So... So, I imagined it then, yeah?- All right, thank you, bud.- Mom... Richmond's finest! Okay, guys. Just you and me for a while. I don't know how are you feeling about that. But we got no choice. How they've been affected by all of this? They are talking to the walls. What did they say? Mama. What's this? They made that. You guys okay? What's so funny? Good night. No! Whatever. Nice butt, Bruce. Victoria.. Come. Mama. You guys know what time it is? I guess you wouldn't. It's late. It's really really late. Don't. Don't what? Don't close the closet. Why not? What's in the closet? Nothing. Okay. It's been an along day. So you guys should get some sleep. Go to bed. You want me to leave the door open? Good night. Just tell me about it. I think someone's coming to visit them.- Who?- I don't know.- And you believe that?- I heard her. She was.. singing to them, like a lullaby, or something. You heard her?- Definitely a her?- Yeah. Sound like this? Yeah, but it was, it was different. Her voice was deeper. Victoria is showing signs. A dissociative personality disorder. I think she could taking on the role of Mama. Literally, becoming her. It's treatable. With time and patience. Am I safe? What? Look, she's 8 years old. Give me a break. I found second entry under the name of that woman. Edith Brennan? Not Edith Brennan. Welcome to isle 17, Doctor. Every archive has one. Lost and found of things people don't want to find. Twenty years ago, when they moved to Clifton Forge cemetery. Some of the oldest, smallest remains, were not claimed by the relatives. They were sent here to be filed. I'm not a religious person, but I do believe, there's a place for human remains. And that's not on the shelf in a Government building. Do you believe in ghosts? I can't say that I do. When a corpse is left out. The elements withered. Desiccated.. Twisting it into a distorted figure that's barely recognizable as a human being. A ghost is an emotion went out of shape. Condemned to repeat itself, time and time again. Until it rights the wrong that was done. What's this? The wrong.- What happen?- Hold him still.- Lorazepam. 4 milligrams.- 4 milligrams of lorazepam. Can you hear me? Relax Mr. Desange. Oh, you drew me a picture. It's a raccoon. Thank you. I do something for you guys too. There you go.- You like it?- Yeah. It's cute. So, how was it been? How is the single Mom?- That's great.- Yeah?- They're terrible. They hate me.- They don't hate you. They hate me. So easy for you to say. You're like the cool uncle. I am the cool uncle. What? What is it, Anny? Just get well soon, so you can come home, and clean their mess, please? You sure about this? Yeah. You okay? What are you doing in here? Here, I'll help. What is it? I don't want you to get hurt. What do you mean? I'm fine. Nothing bad is going to happened.- You can't do that.- Why? She gets jealous. Hey, wait! What's wrong with you? Hello. Hey, Jean. How can I help? It's my day. Are you sure. I thought that was Thursday. It is Thursday. Children make mess. It's how it works.- How are they?- Adorsey. You want coffee? Thank you. Oh my God. What is this? I know, they're wild sometimes. It's not an excuse. Hey, now. They're bruises. Kids get bruise.- This bruise?- It's not like that.- Let me have them.- Sorry? Just for a few days. You can umm.. I don't know. Play with your band, Have a drink with your friends. Jean, I think it's great. But the girls have relationship with their own. I really really do. But right now, I need you to get out of my house. Before I kick your ass. I'll see you both very soon, okay? Hey!- Do you've been coming around here?- I beg your pardon? Do you've been coming at the house, playing with girls? Of cause not! Why? Doesn't matter. Social Services. Who should I speak to if I believe...... my nieces are being abused? Well, what kind of evidence do I need exactly?- How the hell did you forget?- Are you kidding me? You know she wants to take the girls from us. I'm exhausted, I'm sorry. I forgot today is her day. Jesus Christ, Anny. It's one visit. It's not much to remember. Anny, listen. They're just kids. All you got to do is... What? Chill out? Take it easy? You know I can't do this. This is not my job.- This is your job.- I'm out of here in a day,- Just hold it together until then.- All right, fine, yeah. We'll see what happens then. I'll take care of them. Those girls are the most important thing in the world to me.- Awesome.- Anny, you.. Are you nice and relax? Are you feeling sleepy? I'd like you to tell me about Mama. Did she live in that house with you? The house by the lake? Where did she live? In the walls. Where is she now? I don't know. I think you know. I think you know where she is. Where is she, Victoria? Is she here, in this house? Did she come with you? Open your eyes, Victoria. Look at this photograph. Is this Mama?- Is this Mama, Victoria?- Go away!- Tell me about her.- No! Yes! What's going on? Nothing. Nothing's going on.- Gerald, what happened?- I have to go. I'll call you. CLlFTON FORGE- 9. What's wrong? What's under the bed? Victoria? Victoria. Come. Mama. Victoria. Come. Mama.

{"title": "The Doctor Blake Mysteries Bedlam", "content": "Hi, Oriel. Beautiful painting. Hi, Jimmy. David? David. No, David, it's time to take your medicine. I don't want them. David, that's enough. I don't want them from you. David, Dr Laine said you must take them. No. David, take your medication. It's alright, Jimmy. Please, David, would you just... I'm sure this isn't really quite what you had in mind when you suggested professional development. I can't just turn and run the first time it gets difficult. Evening. You might want to watch your shoes. Do you have a name? Violet Ashby, 23 years old. Nurse on duty. Before dinner, she had an altercation with one of the patients, a David Hoyle. During dinner he came back to the bathroom and he attacked her. Looks like the knife was taken from the kitchen. Miss O'Brien! Hey. Having a quiet night out at the old nut house, are you? Oh, sorry. No, I didn't mean... Sorry. Parks. Oh, sir. Death knock, sir? Yeah, her father lives out in Wendouree. Wendouree? Um, don't you usually handle this sort of thing? Not tonight. I could drive him, sir. The doctor's helping me with my professional development. Perhaps this falls into that category. Yes. Yes, I'm sure the Superintendent could drop me home. We might be here for a while. Oh, alright. Just do it properly. Yes, sir. Doctor Winters. Superintendent. My police surgeon, Dr Lucien Blake. Oh. I had the greatest respect for your father. Dr Blake was wanting to know a few things about the attacker. David came to us two years ago, catatonic. He's made great progress in the last few months. Good. Has he ever displayed violent behaviour before? He attacked his mother. She had him committed. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, I don't think so. You should get those cuts on your hands seen to, though. And by the way, any chance I might be able to speak with David? You'll have to talk to Dr Laine. He was frantic when we found him. ECT was the kindest thing we could do for him. Electroconvulsive therapy. Well, it has a bad name but it can be very effective, depending on the voltage and frequency. And when will he be able to talk? He'll be awake in an hour or two but it will be 12 hours or so before he's fully alert. You have secure rooms here, don't you, doctor? We do and we could continue treatment here until the courts need him, of course. Right. Well, as your police surgeon, I recommend you stay here. Save you rostering a man for suicide watch. I mean, up to you, of course. It's all yours. Thank you, doctor. That was an act of kindness. Lucien. Kenneth Laine. Ah. After you. Thank you. Oh, it's so cold in here. Yes. Have you seen ECT before, Lucien? Not in a medical setting, no. What other setting is there? You see a lot of things during war time, Kenneth. We have no idea how shooting electrical impulses through the brain can help these poor souls but it does. And one day I want to know why. Interested in research? Oh, very. I understand he attacked Miss Ashby earlier in the afternoon. Do you know why? Well, David has always had trouble with female authority. David was committed after threatening his mother. Female authority issues. She had ambitions for him to be a classical pianist. I believe the pressure was too much for him. Question is, how did he get his hands on that knife in the first place? I don't know. Kitchen reported it missing a couple of days ago. He's left the light on for her. The boss usually does this. You've never done this before, have you? No, I have, I have. I just... I hate it, that's all. Do you want me to come with you? I knew you'd forget your keys. Here we go. Yes? Ah, excuse me, sir. Sorry to disturb you. Is this the home of Violet Ashby? Put that hat on, constable. Sorry, sir? Hat on. If you're going to do this, do it properly. I used to be in the Force. I know the rules. Yes, sir. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Not on a bloody doorstep. Didn't that boss of yours teach you anything? Who's this? I'm District Nurse Mattie O'Brien. Well, don't just stand there. Cleaning the room already? Oh, there's no point leaving it like that. You're quite sure about that? You are joking, aren't you? I don't know. Oh, Blake! No, I'm serious. I... I... I don't know. Look, say you're a homicidal maniac. No no no no, please. Listen, listen. And you're completely insane, you have mother issues and you've decided you're going to kill the nurse on duty. What do you do? Do you go and steal a knife and hide it somewhere, wait for a few days till she's all alone, then make your move? Maybe. Then you're not insane, are you? Because you've planned it. So what are you saying? Well, I'm saying... I don't know. I'm not getting anything here and that's the problem. I so much preferred working with your father. I can well imagine. We had a call at the station at 7. 40pm this evening to attend the Blackhill Psychiatric Hospital. By the time we arrived, the deceased... Violet. Violet... had... had, ah, sustained multiple stab wounds to the abdomen. It appears to have been a pre- meditated attack. One of the patients. I'm sorry, sir. Was she interfered with? No, sir. Not from what I saw. Is there a Mrs Ashby? Perhaps, sir... No. Violet's mother is no longer with us. They didn't look after her in that place. I told her to leave but there was a matter... With her it was a matter of pride. Well, that's that, then. Constable? Vi wore her mother's eternity ring as a, um... kind of keepsake. It was a mixture of emeralds and diamonds. Your daughter's personal effects will be returned as soon as possible. The ring is the only thing I care about. Make sure it gets back to me. Yes, sir. Bloody hell. Are you OK? Not really. Danny and Mattie seemed rather subdued this morning. I'm not surprised. Hmm. You were going to hand over your receipts. Hmm? Your receipts. Yes, ah, that's right. Um, I do have them, somewhere. Actually, in a few places. But I'll gather them all together. Your father used to do his own bookwork. I offered to help but it was a matter of pride for him. Well, that's where Dad and I differ. Hmh. I have no pride. Did you know, the most modern technique for treating patients with mental illness is to shoot charges of electricity through their brains. Yes. Electroconvulsive therapy. You been reading my medical books? Only when you're not here. How does it work, anyway? Well, no- one's really sure. But somehow it seems to break the cycle. Must be terribly painful. Oh, one couldn't even imagine. However, very few side effects, apparently. Short term confusion and disorientation, certainly headaches. And short- term memory loss. Oh. I'll remember that when you forget to give me your receipts. Ah, I'll take you through shortly, sir. Lawson. Sir. I'm, ah, I'm very sorry to hear of your loss. Everyone is. Would you like me to come with you? No. This one'll do. This way, sir. Doug Ashby. He was my Commanding Officer for ten years. Made my life hell. Is this your daughter? Violet Ashby? Yes, it is. You can head off, Danny. Well done. There was one deep stab. That was the blow that killed her. The knife was driven up under the ribcage, punctured a lung, severed an artery. She would have been dead in 30 seconds. And after that, there were five horizontal slashes across her torso and one curved slash, all surface cuts. Get to the point. That first blow seems almost designed to cause maximum damage, suggesting a detailed knowledge of anatomy. The rest, the rest were just decoration. I'll do the talking. Doctor. I'm not convinced this is necessary. Well, we need to take statements where we can. I'll be in my office. Mr Hoyle? I'm Superintendent Lawson and this is Dr Lucien Blake. I'd like to ask you some questions about last night. I don't remember anything. What's the last thing you do remember? The day room. What time was it? Don't know. Was it before dinner? Was it after dinner? Before. I was playing. Good. And what then? Do you remember having an argument with Nurse Ashby? You understand that she was killed some time later. Yes. Did you attack her? I must have. Nurse Ashby was really nice. She asked me questions. Then why did you kill her? I don't know. David, I've heard you're a very good piano player. Not... good... enough. He thinks he killed her.' Course he did. Then why can't he remember? Because he's a nutcase locked in a padded cell? He didn't present as unfit, just confused. He's fit for trial. And that's what worries me. You know his fingerprints were all over the knife. You coming? Um... I'll catch up with you later. I couldn't help admiring your bird. It's beautiful. I've practised a lot. Yes, I can tell. I'm Lucien. Oriel. What a lovely name. What are you going to paint? I don't know yet. Do you know, my mother was an artist. And sometimes she'd let me come in her studio and I'd sit and watch her paint. I loved it. Would you like to see something I've painted? Oh, yes, please. Oh, that's good. That's... That's really good. Is... is that David? I painted it yesterday. And this is before he had the fight with Nurse Ashby, isn't it? Before and after. Oriel, tell me. What did you think of Nurse Ashby? She asked too many questions. Thank you, Oriel. Hello. I'm Dr Blake. I know. And you are...? Oriel doesn't like you. I'm sure Oriel can speak for herself. I don't like you either. But you do like Oriel, don't you? That's what this is all about. Don't you talk about her. And why shouldn't I talk about her? Because you're weak. Well, some people might debate that. Now look, Oriel is a very lovely young woman but this isn't the best way to gain her attention, is it... Bryn! Bryn, let him go! Let him go! Thank you. Thank you, Dr Winters. They want you to stop upsetting the patients. Oh, do they now? What they really want me to do is sack you but I thought I'd soften it. You can't help yourself, can you? Well, don't you think something's very strange there. Course I do! It's an asylum. It's all bloody strange. Well, that big chap who threatened me sees himself as Oriel's protector. I suggest we add him to the list. Oh, look, there's no bloody list, Blake. Hoyle was found with a knife, standing over that poor girl. Is this where you say something about working with my father? Don't tempt me. You really think something's wrong about that murder? Oh, I'm not sure. Danny. How's Violet Ashby's dad? He's a tough old bloke. Apparently he was the boss's boss when he first started. Made his life hell. Well, explains a few things, doesn't it? Listen, can you tell me where I might be able to find Mattie this afternoon? She was rostered on early this morning so she'll be home by now. I did some checking around for you. Ah, thank you. Did you know Violet Ashby was accused of negligence? Uh, a patient died last year, a Patrick Garret. Apparently, there was some mix- up with his meds and she got off with a reprimand. A reprimand? For fatally mixing up someone's meds? Well, apparently it wasn't quite so cut and dried. The finding was vague. And the hospital took her back. Dear, oh, dear. It's not much of a recommendation, is it? How are you? Perhaps it was a mistake me taking you with me last night. If I'm going to be serious about the work, I need to see all sides of it. Yes. Mattie... She was a nurse and she was my age. And she had... She had her whole life ahead of her. Yes, I know. Does this mean I'm not cut out for this? Oh, not at all. Do you know what it mans? It means you're absolutely the right person for the job. Doctor? A patient here to see you. No appointment. Of course. One of our regulars? No, I don't think so. Oriel. What a nice surprise. Is that one of your mother's? That one? No, no, not that one. Why are you here, Oriel? I'm a voluntary patient. I can sign myself out. That's not quite what I'm asking, is it? You said you liked my painting. Yes, I did. Would you like to see another? It's you. Yes. Do you like it? Wonderful. Really wonderful. You're very talented, Oriel. But I'm not sure that it was a good idea for you to come here. Why not? How did you come to be at Blackhill in the first place? Mum and Dad pay for me to be there. Why? There was a boy I liked. He didn't like me. I got angry. With him? With his girlfriend. I see. And how did you get on with Nurse Ashby? She was always asking questions. Writing things down in her little book. Hmm, that's what David said too. She talked to him a lot. That was after Patrick died. Patrick was a patient, wasn't he? They said Violet killed him accidentally. Do you believe that? Well, I'll tell you something, Oriel. These paintings, boy, they, uh... Well, they really are exceptional. I love the way you capture how you feel and you managed to do that with your painting of David as well. He's easy to paint. You know what he's thinking. So if I was to look at your painting of David, would I see that he was thinking of hurting Nurse Ashby? David would never have hurt her, especially not with a kitchen knife. Why not? His dad was a butcher. He can't stand the sight of blood. And he's terrified of knives. I see. Oriel, where were you last night after David has his argument with Nurse Ashby? Lucien is supposed to mean' bringer of light'. Did you know that? Not really, no. I think they're wrong. What's going on? Oriel Vogel can't tell me where she was last night between the day room and dinner. So? She has a history of jealous attacks and she's prone to inappropriate attachments. Blake, you're a GP. You're not a shrink. What if I can prove David Hoyle did not kill Violet Ashby, hmm? How'd you swing this? You're s'posed to be staying away. I may have lied to Dr Laine. David, how are you? I'm Dr Lucien Blake. Do you remember me? Do you, um, do you remember why you've been locked in your cell? Don't be alarmed, Lawson. David, I want you to take this knife. I want you to take the knife and stab me. Blake. Come on, you won't get into trouble, I promise. No. David, come on. I want you to take the knife. I can't. Blake! You can't take the knife, can you, David? The very thought of touching the blade terrifies you, doesn't it? Lawson, look, I... I don't know who killed Violet Ashby but I can tell you this. Of all the people it could be, it wasn't this young man here. But I did. I had the knife in my hand. I had her blood on me. I can still see her. It's alright, David. I killed her. Killed her. David, hey, bloody hell! Get him out of here! For God's sake! You said you wanted to talk to David for research purposes! My patients are not there for you to play games with! I believe Dr Blake was testing a hypothesis. What hypothesis? Could you give us a moment, Ken? I will not let this happen again. It won't. Now, you don't mind? You've found it hard to believe that David Hoyle could have killed Violet, haven't you? First it was me you were wondering about, then it's Oriel. Oriel has private sessions with Dr Laine. I took her from the day room to Dr Laine's office. I collected her an hour later and took her to the dining room. I see. And what is it you think you see, Dr Blake? And what about you, doctor? I did not kill Violet. And why should we believe you? Because I loved her. I loved her. And she seemed to love me. You were lovers. Dr Winters, what about her reprimand? Violet always maintained she was innocent. How'd you get the cuts on your hand? Some of our patients harm themselves just to give their internal pain an external form. I'm no different. How's the investigation going? Someone's daughter died, a number of lives have been pretty much ruined... and my pride has taken a battering. Oh, I thought you didn't have any. Hah! I thought so too. You mind? Sorry. Thank you. Jean, hang on. What? May I? Hmm? Bloody hell. Jean. Did I wake you? No, I was up. Fancy a drink? No, I'm fine. Ah, here's one you'll know. Here's one you might know. Join in whenever you like! It's a little late for a singsong. Nonsense. Never too late for a song. Yes, it is. You play very well. It's a shame we only hear you late at night. Yeah. Of course, Dad was a virtuoso. Could play anything. Which was why I eventually took up the drums. Oh, bloody hell. Don't worry. You should go to bed. Yes. Dr Blake's son gets it spectacularly wrong again. Self- recrimination and alcohol, Jean, never mix. I'll keep that in mind. Come on, bed. Oops. Um, shall I... No, no, leave that. Oh, it's a bloody mess. Yes. Oh, I should probably... I should probably... probably go and brush my teeth, Jean. Ah, sweet Jean... Sweet Jean... Ah, sir? Violet Ashby's effects. Her dad wanted them back. Should I take them over or...? No, give them here. That'll be all. Sir. One set of car keys. One pair of glasses, damaged. And, ah, two gold rings. One with gemstones. That'll be all, Superintendent. Thanks for the house call. I'm glad it was you. Not that mess of a man you call your constable. Constable Parks is alright. Lawson. It really was one of the loonies that did this, was it? A patient died up there a couple of months ago. They blamed Violet for it. She was trying to prove it wasn't her fault. We think it may have been one of the patients. Well, it's your investigation. I'd be asking a few more questions. Sir. Morning. Ah, good morning. There's a plate of bacon and eggs when you're ready. Thank you. Jean. I do apologise for last night. My, um, playing was horrendous. I wouldn't say that. Dad would have. Thank you for the tea. Lawson. Now, you're going to think I've lost my mind. Ah. Oriel. Am I in trouble? No, no, not at all. In fact, I think you're about to be very, very helpful. There we are. I've been, um, studying your paintings. They really are very good. Lawson, would you mind...? Now this one. Can you tell me what's happening here? You were talking to me. Right. And this one, why is that so much darker? The lights went down. Our power system's very old. It struggles to cope when there's additional drain on it. Oriel? Do you know why the lights go down? It's when Dr Laine does the ECT on us. Right. Right. What about these ones? You painted this one before David had his argument with Nurse Ashby, didn't you? Yeah. And this one was after the argument, wasn't it? He'd left the room. The lights went low. I guessed it was for him. Everyone else was in the day room. Right. What time do you think that was? Seven o'clock. Seven o'clock. Let's have a little look in the book, shall we? Now... here we are. Hoyle, David. 150 volts, 8. 55pm. After Violet was killed. But there's no record of any treatment around seven o'clock. Oriel, can you tell me how many times a day would you say the lights dimmed? Once or twice. If that. Four times a day, at least. I count them. Four. David had two sessions of ECT with Dr Laine that day, before and after Violet was killed. Yet only the latter has been recorded in the log. And there is no way, no way David could have killed Violet Ashby. What's that? Get some help! Step back. Step back, I'll deal with this. Stay where you are! Ted, help me. The cavalry's arrived. This man's insane. Oh... just angry. He wants to know why your name is all the way through his daughter's notebooks. I can tell you why, Mr Ashby. Dr Laine here thinks of himself as a researcher. Lucien. Extra sessions of ECT, and I'm guessing heavier dosages of drugs, just to see what happens. I mean, after all, they're... they're just loonies. What else are they good for? And then one of them died. And Violet was blamed. This was the one who framed her? Yes. You see, Violet started asking too many questions, and he must have worked out that she was onto him. So he murdered her and mutilated her and tried to frame one of his patients. This is absurd! Mr Ashby, please! Sir! Sir! I understand this is your old service pistol. So? Went missing in the changeover. We've been looking for it. I- I just need to do a bit of paperwork, then I can put it to bed. But you must give me the gun. Not till he confesses. Doug, it won't be admissible. You got enough to convict? I'll get it sorted. You've got Violet's notebooks. She kept meticulous records. You should be very proud of her. You'll be charging me with firearms of fences. And possible attempt to commit murder. That's my decision, Doug. Time to go home now. Kenneth Laine, I'm charging you on suspicion of murder and assault. You have the right to remain silent. You're old Tom's boy, aren't you? Yes. So everyone keeps reminding me. Good man, your dad. Psychiatry is such a new field. We're 150 years behind immunology, 500 behind surgery. ECT is only in its infancy. There's a new generation of anti- psychotic drugs. Dibenzodiazepine shows great promise when coupled with hypnosis. And, uh, you thought you'd just speed things along a little? No- one missed Patrick Garrett. No- one would have missed David Hoyle. At least their lives could have been of use to someone. And Violet Ashby got framed when Patrick Garrett died and she started asking questions. David had told me Violet was keeping a notebook. Doses, treatments, everything. I couldn't let that go on. Then you gave Hoyle ECT. And while he was unconscious, you killed Violet... and dragged him into the room. Let him take the knife so that when he woke up... Well, he would have no memory of what he'd done. We've been checking your past records and there are some unexplained patient deaths at other hospitals that you've worked at. Not all of those were research. What did your research tell you after all this? Oh, Lucien. It's far too early to tell. Lovely to hear the piano at a reasonable time of day. Jean. Thank you for tidying up after me last night. I made quite a mess. No trouble at all. Game of Champions, the quiz show where only the smartest survive. Congratulations to our new quiz champion. Don't tell me to settle down. This is fixed!- Simon!- NO! I thought James had a heart attack. Not according to the doctor. Roger and James Holbrook got themselves into a lot of trouble with our Mr Lowe. This man came into my shop making certain wild allegations... They're true. He tried to kill me. Anything else I should know? You should be investigating him for murder. I should have won. I'm, ah, working out how to turn a television set into a murder weapon.

{"title": "Hot in Cleveland Cleveland Fantasy Con", "content": "Hot in Cleveland is recorded in front of a live studio audience. Aww. See, just like the calendar. Ok, John, put your shirt back on. Aww. Thanks for being such a good sport. Yeah, and for teaching us that other thing. Baby CPR. Yes, that. Now, if any babies faint when they hear that I'm dating Sir Emmet Lawson, I'll know how to revive them. You're dating Emmet Lawson, the movie star? How did you drag that out of me? Next, you'll be getting me to admit that he's accepting an award at the Venice Film Festival... oops. Scusi, I say too much. Wow, that must be a rush, dating somebody so famous. Well, I'm a pretty famous actress in my own right. Oh. Joy didn't mention you were an actress. Well, then what do you guys talk about? You've seen him shirtless. Why would they talk? I gotta get to the station. I'll walk you out. Oh, hey. Uh... are you a Star Trek fan? I've actually never seen a Star Trek movie. Well, we're gonna change that tonight. I'm going to boldly go where no man has gone before. Unlikely. You know, Sean just said something that is very wise. Emmet is a lot more famous than I am. That takes a genius? Emmet is world- famous. And fame is an incredible aphrodisiac. Should I be worried? Well, you know what they say. A man is only as faithful as his options, and Emmet's got lots of options. Me, for instance. Ah, that must be Melanie. So are you ready for our business trip? Code name: Secret midnight run. Oh, for God's sake, Mamie Sue, it's not code if it's what we're doing. I'm sorry. I'm just not as gangsta as you. So how did it go? Oh, Alec hasn't come in yet. And I'm a wreck. I have no idea if he heard me say I was in love with him. Oh, come on. You're an actress. How do I play this? Uh, strike a sexy, nonchalant pose, think'60s French cinema. Pink panther? No. Truffaut, Godard, Vadim. I'll just unbutton my blouse. Welcome back, Alec. Hello, Melanie. Hi, Alec. Probably looks like I was sniffing my armpit. That's not what I was doing. I was, um... I was biting off a... a loose thread. Look. I need to make this quick. Before I left, I overheard what you said about me. You did? Oh. Hello, Melanie. Hi, Chloe. Look who's back. Alec. I know. I was with him. It was very romantic, actually. I'm gonna go get some coffee, and then we can get to work. Okay, babe? Okay. So you two are back together. I'm super excited for you. Could you use a drink? I could use a drink. Listen, Melanie. I'm crazy about you too. You are? Practically from the first time I ever saw you. Oh, God, Alec. Oh, wait. What was that with Chloe? Chloe flew down to Cozumel to tell me that our pet cat had died. Even after the divorce, we... we shared a love for our... our little Puss Puss.- I'm so sorry.- Thank you. She would've liked you. Well, Chloe was a mess, and I was trying to console her, and then... well, she misinterpreted it. Mm. Is it possible that you got even prettier while I was gone? Maybe. Wait. So what are we gonna do? I mean, how are we gonna tell Chloe? I don't know. It's complicated. She's gonna want you fired. She's gonna make my life a living hell. It'll probably ruin the business. And she's told me three times she has a wood chipper. You know, we will take this in baby steps. First, I'll get her a new cat. And then when she's in a better emotional place, I'll just tell her,\" we are not together.\" And maybe in the meantime, we can secretly fool around a little? I like the way you think. So let's talk about Cleveland Fantasy Con. The client wants us to wear costumes. I was thinking you should go as captain invincible, and I'll be your girlfriend, Seductra. And Melanie, you can go as Scat, our pet gargoyle. They're lucky to have a pet. I miss Puss Puss. Me too. Hold me.- Scat.- Yes?- No, I mean...- Uh, yeah. Aww, now look what's trending on Google. Emmet Lawson in Venice with his arms around a newly divorced Kate Winslet. Oh, she looks good. I mean, oh, she looks bad, right? But once they committed to that Klingon design, they opened themselves up to a lot of retroactive continuity issues. I mean, which is common in sequels, obviously. Hi, guys. Have fun? It was awesome. I can't believe this poor woman never saw a Star Trek movie. And now I've seen five. Oh, hey. Cleveland Fantasy Con. Yeah, my company's doing all the PR. Joy. You have got to go with me. There's, like, a hundred Sci- Fi booths. I mean, you're gonna be yawning with excitement. I explained to him what you already know, that I yawn when I'm excited. Well, why don't you guys come over to Alec's office tomorrow, and we can all go over together? I'm yawning already! Start picking out your costume.- Costume?- You can't get in without one. I'll call you later. Oh, hey, ladies.\" Live long and prosper.\" Here's the deal. I have fantasized about being with a hot hero fireman for so long, so what if he has a bumper sticker that reads,\" my other car is the Enterprise.\" Oh, no. Another picture of Emmet. Would you stop looking at that? It's just driving you crazy. Oh, now he's got his arms around this gorgeous, young thing. That's Zoe Saldana. Neytiri in Avatar and Uhura in the Star Trek reboot. I liked me better before I knew these things. It's just a photo. You have no proof that anything's going on. Oh, I wish I could just hop on the next plane to Venice, spy on him, and find out if I can trust him. Or you could just decide to trust him. Save your breath, Melanie. She's got her crazy eyes. She can't even hear you. You know, in the 15th season of Edge of Tomorrow, I was wheeled into my cheating boyfriend's hotel room, hidden in a room service cart. Oh, it worked beautifully. Victoria, doesn't that sound a little nutty, even to you? Maybe. But still, I have seven hours on the plane to come up with a better one. Although, adjusting for two Ambien and a vodka, it's more like ten minutes. But hey, I slapped this one together fast enough. It's all gonna be fine. Oh, Sugar, it's the cops! What did you do? Nothing, I'm driving a safe 20 miles per hour below the speed limit. I'm scared. Just play it cool. Follow my lead. Good evening, Officer. Good evening, ladies. The stuff is in the trunk. She's delirious with joy... for the mileage this Prius is getting. I'm gonna have to take a look, ma'am. Way to play it cool. I don't do well under pressure, and now they're gonna send us to jail, where I also don't think I'll do well. It's not so bad. I've been in prison. It changed you, Elka. It changed you. Pipe down. I think I recognize this guy's name. Ladies, I'm gonna have to take you down to the station. Step out of the car, please.- Um, Officer Davenport, is it?- Yeah. Do you have a grandmother named Claire? I do. Give her a call. Tell her you pulled over Elka. Aww, I love her, Alec. Just today at the rifle range I was thinking, how are we gonna move on with our lives? But now, you've made us a family again. You kissed her?- She kissed me.- But there was kissing. I haven't even kissed you yet. I can take care of that right now. No! Not while I'm a gargoyle. First kisses are very important. I've even fantasized about our first kiss. Really? So tell me about this fantasy kiss. Oh, it's so silly, it doesn't even make any sense. It's you and me on a rooftop garden in Paris with twinkly lights and French music and the eiffel tower in the distance, the scent of fresh lavender in the air. So not dressed in a sweaty costume with a concrete face. Well, I'd still jackhammer that concrete. Boy, that came out wrong. I meant I'd still kiss you. Tenderly. The Dothrakis are fighting with the teamsters over who should load the throne of the Seven Kingdoms into the minivan. Sounds like a job for Captain Invincible. Back in a flash. And take your time. Maybe I can find an old cathedral to cool off in. Ah. Hey, where'd you come from? No, no, no. Please don't go out there! Kitty, kitty, kitty. Close that window! My cat's in here. No, she's on the ledge. I didn't know. I'm so sorry.- What?- I d... Well, go out there and get her. That's a 20- story drop. These are not real wings. Oh, okay! I'm going.- Room service.- Avanti. Emmet, what's with room service? I thought we were going out. The whole town's full of hot women. Well, I'm afraid you'll have to fly solo from here on, Jason. Thing is, I'm with someone now. Victoria Chase. Who's that? A wonderful actress I met in Cleveland. Never been with anyone like her. We're... equals, you know? I respect her, I trust her. And well, damn it, I think I might love her. In fact, I'm quite desperate to hear her voice right now. I'm going to call her. Come on, kitty. Kitty. No, no, no. Okay. Kitty, kitty. Yeah, go inside. Go inside.- You're scaring her!- What... what are you doing out here? You weren't getting it done. Oh, look. She's safe.- Well, we can go back in.- No, we can't. Why? I was so worried about my cat, I forgot I am deathly afraid of heights. It's okay,'cause look, the window's not that far away. Aah! If I move, I'll jump! That's part of the phobia, that I'll jump. I really will. I'll jump. And it's all your fault. Chloe! No, no, don't jump! Melanie, why did you tell her about us?\" Us\"? You two are together? We're on the ledge because Chloe's new cat got out. Nice work back there, Elka, playing the grandma card. I don't want to be someone's bitch in prison. By the way, thanks for loaning me Oz. Some pretty gritty stuff. Of course, I lived it. I don't know how you survived being locked up. The secret is, the first day you're in, you steal a dining hall tray and take out the biggest con in the yard. Is that what you did? Yup. Joy still doesn't know it was me. Hi. You look amazing. Help! Pervert! Joy, stop, stop!- It's me.- Sean? You said you were going as a prince. I am. Prince Silversaddle, the strongest pony in all of Equestria. Equestria? Is that a Star Trek thing? You're adorable. Equestria is the magical land of My Little Pony: Friendship is magic. Are you talking about the cartoon for little girls? It's for people of all ages. Don't look so concerned. I'm just one of a whole community of guys who are devoted to My Little Pony. We're called Bronies. And we get together, we dress up, we Brony out. You're gonna love it. I don't know about that. Ah, it's just'cause it's new to you. Look, it's all positive. We celebrate My Little Pony's beautiful ethos of friendship, caring, learning to value people different than ourselves. You're against all that? Some of it. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't push you off this ledge right now. Um, people are watching down there. This costume is a rental? You'll have terrible roots in prison. Oh, stop sniveling. So... Mexico? That was nothing? That was grief. I didn't mean to lead you on, Chloe, I'm sorry.- I'm sorry too.- Shut up, you're fired. This is not her fault. You know in your heart that we broke up a long time ago. I know, and it was all my fault. I never should've cheated on you. Chloe. No couple breaks up over just one thing. Maybe we could just agree to forgive each other and move on. Can we move on quickly? Shoo. I'm not a real gargoyle. I mean, how is this different than a guy wearing a dog mask to a Browns game? It's all just fantasy. Look, come to Paris with me. Keep talking. There's an international Brony convention there next month. Stop talking. Would it change anything if I told you that I was Corporal of the Friendship Brigade? Yes, but not in the direction you want it to change. So this is a deal breaker for you? It's killing me, but yes. I'm afraid so. Please, just take my hand. What's going on? Melanie and Chloe are out on the ledge.- What?- I called 911. I'm a firefighter. Let me handle this. Oh, my God, be careful! Oh, Joy, you look so pretty. Ladies, I'm here to help you.- Just stay calm.- But I'm scared. I give you my word that I will rescue you both. Wow. Melanie. Yeah, in a sec. Oh, oh, Alec. I'll help you in. Just look into my eyes. Do you trust me? Yes. You're very good- looking. And you're beautiful. Are you single? Yes, I am. Me too. You're my hero. Look at him. Maybe I made a mistake. He's a Brony, you know. What's that? I dress up in a horse's costume and go to conventions celebrating My Little Pony. Okay. Oh, Victoria, I'm so happy for you.- He actually said he loves you?- Yes. You know, I toyed with the idea of popping out and surprising him, but a relationship has to be built on trust. Spying has taught me that. Oh, it's 8: 00. To our posts. You are so beautiful. I've been thinking of kissing you all night. Yeah? Why haven't you? Well, I want it to be perfect. So let me see if I remember. Garden, twinkle lights... and French music. And what was that view in the distance? The Eiffel Tower? And the scent of... fresh lavender in the air. Oh. Mm.

We're going to Gencon! The best four days in gaming! Expecting a bigger reaction! well, Joe and I were already going Yeah and now someone from the group actually has a chance of getting laid Hey! So I'm winning a tournament for this card flopper chick She's totally into me Will he be there? yes, Gary, of course he'll be there. He's always there You're gonna have to deal with him sooner or later I don't think I'm ready yet Now all I have to do is learn how to play the nine kingdoms Empires yea tomato tomaaa I don't care Allright! Which one of you guys wants to lose to a guy who's touched boob? Buxtehude, you are summoned to the queen! It is as I feared war has come to Holden The cult of shad Hujem marches against us Meet them in battle, Myriad Save our kingdom The god king shall return I'm warmed up now rematch and use a real deck this time Buxtehude, you are summoned to the queen! It is as I feared war has come to Holden The ord of the floating isles march against us Meet them in battle, Myriad Save our kingdom I said real deck Rematch I'm bored I'll play! I'll play Buxtehude, you are summoned to the queen! It is as I feared war has come to Holden this... feels so familiar Something unlike anything I have ever seen marches against us Meet them in battle, Myriad Are we even playing the same game? I'm playing chibi dance number one, hurray I don't know what you're playing Man you are like an anti montage come on let's leave that sad man alone You just keep getting worse! Please, from the bottom of my heart and I do mean this sincerely Keep trying You're flailing at mediocrity is Marvelous entertainment Might I have a look at your deck It's not like you're going to be able to help Those kids were obviously cheating Now he's blaming kids! This is like Christmas And my birthday all at the same time Let's do a test draw see if we can find the problem Buxtehude Am I summoned to the queen? Yes We must face... Is it war? Has war come to Holden? War?! Heavens no! I merely wished to assess our defenses Have you been sleeping? You look troubled I've been having the strangest dreams at least that's what I think they are dreams Majesty our defenses are woefully inadequate not a kingdom in the world can stand against the dread army and with famine rampant we have neither the troops nor the wealth to prevail If we are too weak to stand on our own then, what we clearly need are allies A political marriage would strengthen our position I'm of more use to us here What do you suggest? How shall we defend ourselves? No let me quest, majesty the way my father did, the way that made Holden great the days of epic questing are over, Myriad They died with your father majesty Assess our defenses I would know how inadequate they are before I take marriage off the table There's your problem Your gold to food ratio is off you've got too few quests and a metric butt load of heroes if you're questing... you need to focus around these two Myriad, and Dundereal We have only these few men Do they look strangely similar to you? We can't supply a larger army and our weapons selection is... embarrassingly out of date we cannot defend ourselves with this my father could have I wonder crafty as he was I doubt even old Simm could have made a go at this with these paltry resources. sly old fox I miss him There has to be something we haven't considered Something we haven't thought of There is Retreat Leave the castle lead your people back into the marches This Holden It has been a wonderful experiment and a welcoming refuge but Simm made may enemies when he carved it from the wilderness enemies with long memories I've been through the fall of a dynasty Myriad Life goes on Life goes on if you allow it Byron, could you please go count the bulk dice again? Sort them by color. Generation Holder won't last a generation Crushed or annexed it's only a matter of time Dundereal won't say what the whole court knows the queen will have to do is marry me off to secure peace which wouldn't have even been an option if I had been born your son! This is about the first 10 years of R9E I have play sets of all the rares All the promos Some of these even go back to the initial print run These are total collector items now Practically impossible to find And I've kept them hidden for years His journals, his unfinished work the quests he never completed I found them Did we need to bring them all? We thought these lost Where ever did you find them? No where that can't be repaired I'm sorry? These are rather heavy We can complete the quests he never did Find the artifacts and allies we need to defend our kingdom, don't you see? And these are the edge you need You know how to play this game? Yes, and I can teach you if... and I mean you gotta convince me if it's a worthwhile use of my time so I'll put it to you straight this girl... is she worth it yeah there's just something about her the drive, the poise the way she made that 11 year old cry the moment I saw her I just knew this girl's special this is a girl that I could really really have sex with yeah that's all I needed to hear with this deck you'll be questing so you'll need a blend of strong mid- game quests game ending knockout quests and quick cheeser quests to get you started here is a classic a most peculiar lamp oh just so you know when I remember this I'm totally gonna imagine the matrix training sequence what? cards, lots of cards so the lamp yeah it's 10 renown plus you get to search for and play 3 cards from your own deck if you got 40 renown already this will push you over the edge most peculiar lamp lying in wait to hijack I'm gonna assign colonel baker who is using his reaction to assign mike who is using his reaction to assign the Chaplin who motherfuckin ha where'd they come from? I've been wondering that for 30 years thanks for showing us the way now stay down down I said we need that lamp this strikes me as an appropriate time to slip by in the vain hello Mike is it? sleep! aaah! you stay down hey who am I? baseball! democracy apple pie you are ageless, not immortal you can't go throwing yourself into risk like that why ever not? Holden needs you well Holden has me the lamp oh baby oh baby man, good game, wow everybody, give it up for our second place finisher second place? what, did I miss the finals? well I mean, it's a... you know... it's a formality I'm not in the know today who am I playing? oh, you.. you don't know allright! The die has been cast and the cards drawn and this year's sacrificial lamb will be played by a newcomer Shawn Cassidy! it's Cas the legend mark the Meach Mayjam! Meach... Meach... Meach... Meach... Meach... Meach... Meach... Meach... Meach... Meach... Meach... Meach... rise my friends so what are you supposed to be like the end boss or something? look around you Mr. Cassidy what you see is a row of championship banners for this is my home store it is here I have qualified for every global storyline tournament since the dawn of the game and yet the topic of conversation tonight is not my inexorable 10th consecutive qualifying tournament victory but is instead of some newcomer slinging a slate of vintage quests why is this? regimes change and empires fall that sure looks comfy does that come with the win? one half or one third? will I be defeating you tonight with one half or one third of my deck pick half... it's less embarrassing I think you're already playing with half a deck there buddy no... one third it is... you go first we're not cutting for it? start out strong set yourself up for victory there's a reason you're carrying three of these biggest turnip?! quick 2 renown biggest turnip?! not every quest gets to be epic maybe I'm missing something what exactly is the big heroic deed here? growing a giant freak vegetable? more or less and said mutant tuber has the potential to win you the game? I don't think turnips are tubers so... your empire's at war and regardless of the tactical or economic realities on the ground you could theoretically win a military conflict by growing a turgid bit of purple stew bait hey, I have an idea how to end this flashback oh? turn take another I'm sorry? take another turn I insist now take another come on man take another turn it's like we talked about a desperate offer could save your ass you get 3 renown to give 1 of your quest rewards to one of your opponent's guys and that helps me how? it might buy you a turn might! I said might a word of advice Mr. Cassidy no matter how gimmicky your deck the jank that gets you through the Swiss won't hold up in the elimination rounds tell your puppet master questing is dead our champion for the 10th consecutive year the Meach! Meach... Meach... Meach... Meach... Gary it's conversations like these that keep you single but, but the logic bears out, right? tell me I'm wrong here's the thing I'm not! If I have to pick a side you do fine yes, two dicks would grow back see? it's simple science! I don't know what Lodge's problem is hey, hey ah, can I talk to you? please! hey! you did great he beat me in 9 cards the Meach has won 4 Gencons! he's arguably the best player in the game today great, so... how am I supposed to beat him at Gencon? with any luck the legacy will knock him out of the tournament ok, how am I supposed to beat the legacy? with any luck the Meach will knock them out of the tournament you're not helping! every year in the sweltering late August heat a strange creature will follow its instinctual migration pattern here to urban Indiana the gamer during this great annual migration gamers of all species from the Midwestern neck beard to quivering man joy will descend upon Indianapolis in the tens of thousands a group of gamers, called a table is virtually unheard of in these numbers but congregate they do every year for Gencon they have come such a distance for the same reasons as any migratory mammal to build up resources for the long winter months and to mate. the pageantry of the 4 day con is not to be missed members of this giant table will adorn themselves with colorful plumage and perform bizarre mating displays to stand out from their rivals competition among males for the demographically fewer females is fierce but seldom lethal of the gamers who do successfully mate many will return a year later with their offspring the geeklet, assuring the cycle of gamer life will continue for at least another generation but for every successful pairing there are multitude of failures male gamers who fail to successfully find a mate must return to their feeding grounds alone where they will content themselves with their comic books video games, and their latent misogyny I knew you had it in you. you're being a bit of a dick come on, we gotta get you signed up keep working on that! yes my master! ok today's all about placing high enough in the Swiss that you advance to the elimination rounds that's where the real fight begins but first we gotta get your deck logged in the... are you even listening? oh Fortuna... hey Natalie! hey wenchhead! remember me? I'm the guy who's gonna put your king on the throne right! only it's queen and.. oh dear god you thought I was serious I expect that date when I win awesome why's a bowling team here? so full disclosure my tazer's not actually legal in the states had to send away for it to Singapore I'm detecting a hint of negativity it's a.. it's you! from... right! yeah! displaced military switch tacs yeah! you're telling me he plays? are you joking? oh my gosh, he's awesome well... you lasted what like nine cards against the Meach? 9 cards, yeah they got a lot to say don't they? have you recruited him yet? ah... why no she has not tell me more oh man, check it so a bunch of us story players formed an alliance to take down the legacy, and... keep questing in the game. we're gonna get the best anti- starvation deck into the finals whether it's ours or somebody else's isn't that great? oh check it, even we got buttons! buttons, wheeee! wait, wait, so... it's an alliance to lose? clearly nothing that you would be interested in it's an alliance to win as a team oh shit, like NASCAR? and we'd love to have you man ah... here's the thing... I'm trying to wrangle a date with ginger smack over there Natalie? yes and I can't do that unless I get her monarch ass down on the god head seat so... I have to win just gimme the damn button I wanted to thank everyone for making nine empires the game it is today you know 15 years ago when we started this people told us we were crazy for making a card game where the players could influence the story and, well, they were right but here we still are and here's your head writer for nine empires: Penelope Chalk The fate of the world lies in your hands brothers and sisters in 3 days time we will crown our new monarch until then we cry havoc! HAVOC! cry havoc! HAVOC! let slip the dogs of war! it's a dollar per roll or 7 for five, but you have to roll and you only get a kiss on the cheek if you roll a 20 otherwise, it's a chocolate kiss so 1. 4 rolls per dollar at the wholesale rate with a 5% chance of return will yield a total bulk value of approximately$14. 25 per kiss so, here... is five hundred dollars you owe me 35 kisses it's for charity come here come here badges please there's so much cool stuff here oh that's really nifty there's so much going on CHlBI CHAN! CHlBI CHlBI CHlBICHAN CHlBI CHAAAAAN CHlBI CHAAAAN CHlBI CHAN! Hey look!

I do. It means that if he wins the next match we all advance alright? that's some go team stuff right there right? that's why we're here female shoo! you got a pretty mouth Buxtehude, you are summoned to the queen It is as I feared war has come to Holden the dread army of Ixhasa marches against us at the very least we can stop wondering when they come the undead are already burning our crops blading our fields they aim to starve us out! if anything we can thank them for using consistent tactics one mo what quest awaits us? to pale mountain? we need to stop an army not have questions answered the apple of life then? no one's died besides we'd never complete it why wouldn't I complete it? because they'd never find your body this card needs to be torn in half to activate the quest reward it's a rare rare a Gencon participation card from 98 there were only 500 of these ever printed just slide that back in your deck then where are we bound with the dead at our door? plague of locusts on your farm consistent tactics plague of locusts on your other farm I take the field turn here let's find a most peculiar lamp with all haste thwarting with skinny according to my father's notes the lamp was entombed in the wall winded old man? ehhhh you again I'm... sorry? you're about to wish for a bountiful harvest to feed your people and torrential rain to turn your home battlefield to mud this will stymie the dread army and buy you enough time to quest for victory, yay... yeah that sounds good well? yes, we'll do that you actually have to say that you... we wish for a... bountiful harvest which is ho in this season and pairs quite nicely with... torrential rain and maya for my third that is a bounty you're the first guy to knock a legacy player out of the tournament ok, so, these you can totally redeem for other cards and this book is a history of the game ok... so he can play ok so he can play hell yes he can play! you lost! to whom? who the hell is that? some punk throwing vintage quests out of Holden quests? you lost to a quest deck? fascinating... your wishes are granted I thank you to Holden? oh no need your enemy has withdrawn how can you know that? because... this is hardly the first time we've done this dance it's not always the same enemy and it's not always you or the pair'em and you are not always victorious you do usually have the turnip though ignore him he'd trick you out of your last wish does this have something to do with this... sense that I've been living the same moments over, and over again? my... you are a perceptive one excuse us what are you talking about? it's hard to say, it's it's... it's a feeling like a dream you can't quite remember a sense that we've done it all before like we're trying to remember the steps to a dance that we can't quite recall until we're dancing it again the phrase you're looking for which from a language of artiste and romance is deja vu I would know more of this how to explain... this realm is locked in a quantum state your world exists only as possibilities this encounter is but one of many iterations shadows... like the one you may become of a single true reality that has yet to be determined when this version of events fade it will do so as a dream but one you will not remember for it will never have occurred and you will return to the place you always do I am summoned to the queen with no memory this has happened a thousand times before this can't be true this can't possibly be true good to be here it's good to be here so... iron chops Jayce would like to invite you... Oh.. no no no, and others... Jayce and other members of the alliance would like to invite you to the LARP tonight sorry, I don't LARP I'm not a..

Give us a farming province we'll send you an army no sell it to us, we'll give you a good price why should it fall to us to fight the dreaded army it's clear whose fault this is Arcanix they shattered the new mountain with their magics and exposed the sea you will not put this on us no.. excuse me you provoked them with your crazy magics that pyramid was under water till you woke them up and now that we have awoken you are all doomed if you want our help it might be wise not to insult us all of you! all doomed if it's anyone's fault its yours a city king bomb was supposed to destroy the seat entirely what... what? dudes seriously those costumes are unreal you guys went all out ok a little too into it why does it keep happening? nice! can barely tell the tale I'm so glad you changed your mind I was hoping you'd come why aren't you wearing a costume? oh I, I am, I'm LARPlNG as a guy who hates LARPlNG she's behind me isn't she? yea... directly. look, this may look stupid to you but it's one of the highlights of my year so if you're gonna be a colossal dick just go dick it up in the corner where were we? you were belittling us so much for your vaunted technology so how is it I haven't seen you at a tourney? vintage cards like that you just don't find them laying around ah they're a friend's I'm just passing through well enjoy it while you can this might be going away a lot of players are leaving the game yeah, but, not these guys really? aren't these your most hardcore fans? they can't stand to see what the legacy is doing to the game con after con tourney after tourney what they need is hope really what they need is a champion I'm just passing through hey we didn't see you complain when our a- bomb blew up the god king and that was our last chance to get home we'd help miss but there's just goddamn too few of us we can't risk open warfare and leave the home state undefended what about your neighbors would they be of any help? HAH! the Hujem? you remember the god king arrrr... we'll have no dealings with the displaced let the dead take them but if one of us falls, we all fall the strong of faith will prevail forget it a waste of time you really need to get over this minor dispute with the displaced minor dispute? they killed our god! and we'd do it again! not helping! there will be no accord it's not enough that doom is on the march we must be complicit in our own downfall and where are you? because you're clearly not here I'm really not what would you say if I told you that none of this matters? nothing happening here that it's all for naught I'd say I don't understand I however do at a diplomatic summit? you were not invited it was open to the representatives of the nine empires, was it not? and is Ixhasa not one of the nine? there's a lad a word with your lady she's not my lady so you know it's liberating isn't it knowing that the fate of our world is not determined by us I don't believe you I don't need you to believe me we're but pieces on a board fleshling toyed with by powers unaware of our existence powers that favor Ixhasa the hands that deal our fate do so in our favor the outcome has already been determined you need not die with the rest of your people Dundereal need not die with the rest of your people what has come over you? you just do not understand! nothing we do her matters! we cannot affect the outcome! the entire world is at stake the entire world the kingdom your father build and you speak of abandoning perhaps we can escape the cycle oh get a hold of yourself! Did you win? it's a LARP oh so you all lost? where'd she go? hey cardligula you seen Natalie around here anywhere? ah, you're confused you see in human society when someone asks a question unless she's a card in one of these decks I haven't seen her did you see me beat that starvation deck today? I quested the shit out of it you beat the lowest ranking member of the legacy with a deck they'd never seen congratulations are not yet in order riiiight oh uhmmm, Jayce and Natalie and some of the story players have this whole little alliance thing going I have no dealings with the lesser kingdoms is that a starvation deck? cuz if it is... I'm sorry did I interrupt your sentence with the middle of my ritual? you dropped this in each... in each of these envelopes is a potential future for the nine empires nine versions of the story depending on who wins the god head seat by a vote of 37: 19 the regional qualifying winners have chosen war over diplomacy and as a result the elimination round will be played under conquest rules any unique hero killed from this point forward will be permanently dead in the storyline Buxtehude, you are summoned to the...

Lewis you look like a Lewis to me I see that we are evenly matched not really no is this going somewhere? you're a good player, yes but new inexperienced you'd be wise to ally with us go your own way if you must but be warned, we set our agenda into motion years ago and it is unstoppable now we're gonna turn this into another poker another magic starvation is just a tactic to frustrate the story players and it's working, it's driving them away from the game with them gone, the publishers need to look for different revenue streams a. k. a sponsored tournaments with cash prizes and that means money you hear me? getting paid to play games wait that's it? that's the big evil plan? what about the story? fuck the story! that's just there to keep people invested and after we kill questing when I win tomorrow in a couple of years the only players left will be guys like us and you could be a part of that... oh... did you just brain freeze yourself? no... the legacy has dominated the tourna scene yeah ok we're done here you're doomed if you cross us!

I accept your concession sidebar now! what is your angle, ok? how is this supposed to get me in bed? when it started it was all I was after but then Kinda against my will I got invested in the story, Myriad and the group and if I had my deck I'd hurl it headlong into getting our queen on the throne date or no so quit wasting time on me and go kick some undead ass hey buddy have you got Cas's deck list? ah yes but I can't give it to you listen up people ok so we've got.. oh sh... we've got eight minutes to rebuild Cas's deck or he can't play hey look I know, I know it's not gonna be easy right, some of these cards have been out of play since forever but I have seen them!

HAVOC! cry havoc! HAVOC! and lets slip the dogs of war! CHlBI... CHlBI CHAN cannot wait to get my beer on hey no autographs dude Buxtehude, you are... not again I had hoped for a more even match upon a return engagement I see I'm to be disappointed... I have never had such a bad draw it's like these cards have a mind of their own will Myriad be joining us? it's like she's not even in here! what do you mean, gone? her chamber is empty and there's a map missing from the cache which map? yours is a world of many possibilities, yes and few are aware of all the versions played out before the course of events resolves what of those who control our destiny? the ones playing games with our fate? you have it backwards! these players do not determine the fate of Countermay they are reading its history and through a means of divination as old as time cards? it is as I predicted your quest tricks may get you through the Swiss but they will not hold up against an elite build in the elimination round there is no time left to quest majesty Malchior is here the hell have you been? do we stand any chance of defeating them in a pitched battle? None well then... Chealy? to battle! quite liked Myriad it's a pity another Buxtehude has to die because you two overestimated yourselves I got nothing damnit! this is why we hunt and you gather Lewis weaver advances to the final round great game Natalie I am here to treat with your queen I've seen you beat a legacy starvation deck a feat I myself have been... unable to accomplish what's that have to do with anything? a test draw! that's what I saw you doing you were doing a test draw against starvation If I tailor the deck to beat starvation I leave myself open to military it was a gamble you overestimated yourself touche I propose an alliance oh so now you want an alliance watch your tone I'm one turn away from crushing your pathetic little army an army that, oddly enough... has show that it can beat starvation so here's my offer support Malchior in exchange we will meet the dread army in the field and delay them long enough for Buxtehude to quest for victory should you succeed you will choose king hammerdoom of Malchior to sit the god head seat and Myriad will marry prince Rannon to make our alliance permanent reject this offer and Holden burns accept this offer and I will concede this match this is my choice my answer is yes then our swords are yours what's wrong with you?( Don't listen to me--) where are we?( my voice is full of lies) That's not my real mouth Gary Hekaru? Is that really you? No, not really just another hallucination born out of your rapidly deteriorating mental state I blame the energy drinks don't try to stop me I can't stop you that's not really why I'm here I'm here to ask you one simple question is this what a ninja dragon rider would do? you know what he did to you! I certainly do and if you truly believe that this is the right way to honor our memory torch the fucker! but you're gone you and all the other ninja dragon riders you're gone, Hekaru acceptance is the final step and all the deliciously appropriate revenge in the world won't bring you back Remember us Gary remember us and we shall rider our dragons which are also ninjas across the skies forever there there let it all out ok... getting a little weird now thank you Hekaru I think that I'm ready to hate productively again I'm gonna be ok I'm gonna be ok hello a little help please the final round will take place with Ixhasa and an alliance between Malchior and Holden You should have been one of us man hell you are one of us dude, I'm nothing like you it's not too late to join you know you and me we could rule this scene cut the crap and your deck allright but consider this the Meach the guy who beat you in 9 cards he's afraid to play me music! don't look surprised you had to know that it would end this way your choices sealed your fate before we had begun to play stop blaming luck and chance poor craftsmen only blame their tools remind the other fools what happens when they face the legacy we are the legacy! what have you brought us? nothing the emissary of the dread army it's like she know every move I'm gonna make she's everywhere thwarting every quest we won't last much longer I have only one quest left one we've never attempted I was wondering when you'd arrive the apple of life which blossoms... once a millennium and has enough life force to raise an entire army shall I eat it? return to the golden ageless life of the fey we could run away together spend more stolen moments in side chambers of course... Holden will fall and it's people join the dread army but if that's what meant to happen who are we to prevent it I understand now what you were trying to tell me about our world the emissary filled me in when she gave me the gift you are not Dundereal shall I prove it? in more intimate ways a string of kisses down your spine perhaps I will kill you one hand in the small of your back the other at your navel to steady you hoist you, like a mainsail take my word, little girl for I've been around long enough to know there is no escape from predeterm... we make our own fate old man five short too bad you won't last the turn for this? my army's starved and died for this bit of sodding fruit? it can raise the dead! the dead are here you may have lost the kingdom to save one man saving Dundereal was never my intent activating apple of life not that it really matters but who are you raising from the dead? you oh you clever bitch what just happened?

Mr. CHOl... let's end this here. No, it wasn't me... Ja- sung, believe me! I'm not a rat! Think about it, I served the chairman for ages, why would I betray him and snitch for the feds? Ja- sung! Gonna be a rat till the end? Ja- sung, please... Please! Please! It's done, boss. Let's go. Yes, sir. LEE Jung- jae CHOI Min- sik HWANG Jung- min produced by HAN Jae- duk co- produced by KlM Hyun- woo written and directed by PARK Hoon- jung< NEW WORLD> The prosecution has dropped charges of embezzlement, stock price manipulation, and tax evasion against Goldmoon's chairman SEOK... This non- indictment concludes a year- long investigation. The prosecution justified their decision based on information provided by SEOK and due to lack of sufficient evidence. The police, on the other hand, are outraged by this outcome, and accused the prosecution of being too lenient to a high profile felon. In other news, car ferries will connect Incheon and Shanghai... The Incheon Port Authority has issued Goldmoon a marine passenger transportation permit... And the Shanghai boss? He'll arrive on tomorrow's first flight. The fuck? You boys came to greet? Mr. LEE himself came out to greet me! Come on, let's just go. Yo bro, what's with the sour face? I've been gone for a long time. You left a few days ago, we don't have time for this shit. At least pretend you're happy to see me! Suk- mu, come here, shitbag, take a hit for your boss. Get me a bouquet of red roses, motherfucker. You're no fun! Come on, wait for me. Yo bro! Fucking asshole! Let's go. This is the newest model. I sold my left ball to buy this bad boy. How is it? Do I look like a celeb? Cricket chirping... How's the old man? It might be today or tomorrow, the doctors can't say for sure. Goddammit, at least he'll die happy. Why did he have to get his dick wet at that hour? He got what he deserved for never sharing his Viagra. I doubt someone put a hit on him. Very nice. Brand name really adds class, I can't see shit! Wait a minute! Where's the bag? Here it is. Here, a present. What is it? I picked it up when I bought mine, for your wife. In exchange for a healthy baby.- Knock- offs again?- What? You ungrateful... I got certificate of authenticity! Forget it, give it to your wife. Please stop buying shit like this! So obvious? This one too? Not as much. You motherfucker! He says it's obvious! You said it looked legit! You lying sack of shit! You should've looked carefully! He's your junior, right? Punch him, now! Come on, slap him! Harder! Harder, motherfucker! I'm sorry! Mr. SEOK was pronounced dead... What?! Who's dead?!- Say what?!- Boss!- Boss!- Who's dead?!- Please calm down.- Let go of me! If you were paid that much, bring him back to life!- Please stop, sir!- Let go of me! Where's the hospital chief? Get him down here! Goldmoon Corruption Investigation Report I cross- referenced both data. Yes, they're the same. Thank you for coming, thank you. Thank you, this way please. God fucking damn! Don't those fucks know when to lay off? Look how many cars there are. It's too hot. What the fuck?! Look at these guys. Who gave you permission to take our photos? You're violating our privacy. Not here to pay your respect, so who do you work for? Speak up, cat got your tongue?- Boys.- Yes, boss. Get their mugshots. We might bump into them later. Yes, boss! Get your cameras out. Smile for the camera, bitches! Why exactly are you hounding us? You're stalking us? You sons of bitches. I'll stalk your bitch, son. You think you're so famous and shit? We're checking up on our favorite hooligans. This is all busted, what do you say to that? So lieutenant KANG is behind it all? Our last go- around wasn't painful enough? So what brought you here with your minions? Are you fucking deaf? I told you we're here to work, checking up on criminals. Don't worry about us, go bury the old man. Goddammit. How can we, when you're being so blatant? I'm not blind. Should I make you then? Your foul mouth hasn't changed one bit. But you better watch out. It may lead to your unfortunate demise.- Wanna bet?- What? Whose head will roll first, yours or mine. What the fuck?! Idiots. There's plenty of space beside the old man's grave. Stupid pricks. And this is the latest model. Ink on the receipt isn't even dry yet. Buy yourself some smokes with the change. Oh yeah, I got a promotion! I'm a section chief now. Don't forget! Fucking cops... Since we're all acquainted, fetch us some food while at it. I saw steaks heading in there. Is it certified Korean beef? You fucking idiots. I want a written apology for this. Yes, sir. This is SEOK Dong- chool As the chairman of Goldmoon, he transformed the Jaebum gang into a national crime syndicate. He died in a car crash 2 weeks ago on his way back from his mistress. I heard, so? Because of his sudden death, his seat remains vacant. As you know, Goldmoon is an amalgamation of the Jaebum, Jeil and Northmoon gangs, the largest syndicate in Korea. They pushed into an enterprise model, and now owns 8 subsidiaries, growing into a mid- size corporation. We may never be able to contain them ever again, if we do not take action now. To the point. We'll influence their succession plan. Who are the candidates? JUNG Chung, Goldmoon executive director. He's in charge of construction, and has close ties with the triads. He's a Chinese descendant, and former head of Northmoon, until he joined forces with Jaebum's SEOK. Since he handles Goldmoon's main business, he's the heir apparent even though officially he's third in line.- Opposition?- LEE Joong- go. Goldmoon's managing director and 4th in line. He handles private loans, pyramids and entertainment businesses, he was Jaebum's# 2 under SEOK, but JUNG Chung pushed him down. So they're in constant conflict. Still, he's backed by Jaebum clan, which holds the most power. So it's between these two? Officially,# 2 spot is held by JANG Su- ki, but it's strictly a formality and he's not involved in day- to- day. Can this be done? What if it fails? It'll only cost their lives. Watch what you're saying! Alright, you have my blessing.- But keep me in the dark.- Of course, sir. What's the operation code name? New World, sir. Operation New World. Dammit, there's nowhere to go. You haven't improved much in 6 years. You know me, I hate headaches. At least try to make the most of it. For what? All this will be over soon. There's a succession board meeting in 2 days, all the regional bosses will attend it. Their profiles are in the report. Okay, I'll check. By the way, this won't... affect me or change our deal, right? Actually, got a new order for you today. Have you lost it? You got a handler for a reason. Why don't you go around waving your badge? What is it this time? What the hell's going on? You said I'm done when SEOK's taken care of!- The situation's changed...-'Changed'?! Is it my fault he wasn't prosecuted? Or that he's dead? Whose idea was this? Which fat head came up with it? There's only 3 people in the world who know about you. Was it you or director KO? You insolent fuck, watch your tone! After posing to be a gangster for 10 years, you sound like the real thing. I can't do this anymore, keep your word. Yeah? That's right. Fine, then don't. And just quit. You're good at being a gangster. Give up the law and be a gangster for real. Isn't that a better life for you? Cop salary is rat shit. What's your income now? A fortune, right?- Are your serious?- Wait a minute. What'd they do to you if they found out you're a cop? Is this fun to you? Are you fucking with me? Look at you, you're a bonafide gangster. Let go. Ungrateful prick. Look at the positive side of this, it'll only take a few weeks. You did this for 8 years, this is nothing. Until the successor is decided. Continue supporting your boy JUNG, it's no big deal. And I'll get you the promised overseas reassignment. This special op will double your pay. You'll practically be a made man. Take this with you. I picked out a mobile and some toys. I heard it's a son. How did you know that? You got a tail on me? Don't get paranoid, we're just protecting our asset. You're our most prized investment. Shit... It's not safe to delay appointing the successor. We'd prefer to appoint one ASAP. No organization can maintain stability when the head's been chopped off. We got business in the works and if we don't attend to them, people will start to get funny ideas. It'll get ugly real fast. Then let's call a board meeting this month and vote. Any thoughts? I agree with you all. What about you? There's no reason to object. It's not good to keep that seat empty too long. Okay, it's settled then, we'll call a board meeting next week and appoint a successor. If there's nothing else, I'll head out. Got business to attend to. Yo. Since we're all here, let's grab a bite. Forget it. I got no time for bullshit pleasantries over a meal, especially with you. I'd rather choke to death. Shit, those are some choice words. I'm off then. Hemorrhaging asshole. Senile old fucks, rolling their eyes and shit. Fucking eunuchs. Oh yeah, bro, I have a big favor to ask you. I'm not interested. You cold bastard. I have to get back to Shanghai in 2 days. Couldn't finish the deal because the old man got himself killed. It'll only take a few days, look after my office for me. Alright. Fuck, you scared me, lighten up. Go fuck yourself, little bitch. If Joong- go knew I left my nest empty, he might stir shit up, so keep it to yourself. He's not going through puberty, he won't do anything. There're too many eyes right now. That fucker is a walking puberty. Where's the car? Didn't I tell you to park close?! What the fuck? Did I scare you? Got a jolt? Look, this isn't funny! I'm sorry. You piece of shit, drive properly! Our colleagues had heart attacks. My apologies, boss. How the fuck did you get a license? I thought you had important business. Forgot the way out? Need a map? You need to work on your sense of humor. Take care, you hear? Take care. See that? You see what I mean? That prick won't change until he's buried. Shit, I think I pissed a little. Yo bro! That was nice. Damn, my heart's pounding! Let's go get some pussy, or get shitfaced with pussies. I'm fine, you go ahead.- Shit.- Go on. I don't enjoy fucking those virgins, I just wanna calm my nerves.- In- out, in- out.- Go on, drive. Come on, hop in. I really can't today. Get in! Follow us. Yo bro, something on your mind? You look like shit. I'm just... tired lately. We got important shit coming up, you need to shape up. I'll get you some ginseng meds. I thought your face couldn't get any uglier, but I guess not. Hello? I don't need a loan, I'm rich. I pray to God, I hope your child takes after your wife. We have to play the hand we're dealt, it'll all work out for the best. You just follow my lead like a sheep. Funny shit, huh? My chink brothers! Fill your glasses! Raise your glasses! Let's drink to his unborn child! Let's all pray, please take after his wife! You speak the truth!- Cheers!- Cheers!- Lemme pour for you.- Yes, sir! Sit down, asswipe, with the big cup. Will you stop messing with the leaf? They got feelings too. How are other clans reacting? Them? They're busy figuring out who to side with. Indeed, this will determine if they'll live or not. How's Ja- sung? Heard he's got a kid on the way. How's he coping? Of course not, would you be? But what can he do? He has no say. Keep a tight leash on him, we can't lose control of him at this point... I know, I know. The plan's good. Alright, proceed as written here, do this right. My boss... I mean... I uploaded LEE Joong- gu's file that JUNG Chung had. That won't be enough to charge him. It should be enough. We'll take care of it. Who's the other snitch? Is he a cop too? Or intelligence? I'm not in the loop on this intel either. What's the grand plan? There must be one by now. Can't even tell me that? Shut up and do what I'm told? What am I to you all? Even those scumbags trust me, why can't my own guys? I follow all your orders!- As per protocol...- Fuck that! Fuck your protocols! My neck is on the line here. I'm a cop too, we're on the same side, right? JUNG's flying out tomorrow afternoon, check the itinerary. Nice shot.- Nice shot.- Great form. Do you all get to hit the green nowadays? Usually, but not so much these days. You know how unhinged things are now... With the chairman's passing and everything. Goddammit. Was that for me to hear? No, no, of course not. Why'd we pick a fight with you? Of course not. We're family, no need to get all worked up. Family? So how do you explain your behavior then? Abandoning one of your own and sucking up to JUNG. Didn't you? Or you? Who was it? Joong- go, listen to me. You got it all wrong. We couldn't possibly have done that. We just accepted him because the chairman adored him.- We take care of our own.- That's right. That chink bastard is not one of us. Right, right. So next week's pissing contest is pointless then. JANG won't side with anyone, and JUNG's clan doesn't have enough sway to overcome this family, isn't that right? That's right. Everyone knows we got your back. That's the truth...- But...- Something for you? Of course there is. You get to keep your head. Was the chairman's death really an accident? I feel terrible about leaving like this. Will you stop it? Stop kissing my ass. It's because I feel really bad about it. Why don't you just stay then? Gonna be like that? Alright, I'll stop. In any case, just make sure... Okay, okay, I'll stop, you bastard.- Fine, fine!- Okay, okay! I'll buy real shit this time, not cheap knock- offs. Will you just go?! Not like you're off to war. Is something really up? What's with the attitude lately? I'm off to war, fuckhead! Good afternoon. Have a safe trip! What, you got an appointment with me? Come with us, you'll find out. I'm his lawyer. What's this about? Go through me first. What's he saying? Come with us quietly. Why not. But will you reimburse the ticket if I miss the flight? Don't you worry. We fly first class. National Police Agency Chief KANG Hyung- chul I've been really busy with work, so what exactly is the purpose of our chat? It's because of that work of yours. Goldmoon Corruption Investigation Report This is pretty serious stuff, right here. Make a decision. There's still time before your flight. I'm gonna smoke. So you want to take care of Joong- go, in other words, you'll back me up? Right, as you know, you got no chance against him. Thanks for seeing me in a good light, but we're not playground bullies. And we're not mall cops.- You're underestimating us.- Your words, not mine. Are you really asking for something to prosecute him? We don't always see eye to eye, but this is pretty low. Read it on your flight. This looks like our own stuff. Fuck, I thought we smoked out all the moles. Looks like there's more left. Let's get one thing straight. You accused SEOK's men as moles and eliminated them. And SEOK was a necessary casualty on your way to the throne. Right? Make of that what you will. If you collected this much dirt, can't you do whatever you want? It's for everyone's good. We're asking for consent before the shit hits the fan. Consent? More like a notice. Enough for today, you're late for your flight. By the way, how did you know I was flying out today? And perfect timing too. Now it all makes sense. You got plenty of rats inside. Must be nice. Look into him. Any dirt in his official police records to personal details. Money is no object, get the best people on it. I know just the right group for it. And... call the Yanbian hobos. Will you handle this yourself? Fucker... So he wants to play? Yeah, are you on Joong- go? Good boy. We're moving in first thing tomorrow so gather some muscle. Okay. How's that old geezer JANG? What can a feeble chump do? He just leads a lonely life. Aside from other geezers dropping by for tea, nothing, boss. Tea won't class them up. Stay on those senile pricks until the board meeting. Those eunuchs can't be trusted.- Don't worry, boss.- Yes, boss. If one of them tries to step out of the line... I'll chop their balls off and feed them to their kids. Shit, you fucking scare me! You never did learn the art of subtlety and elegance.' Chopping balls off', listen to this guy. By the way, boss, what about JUNG Chung? When you take the chair, he'll dust up a storm. Enough business talk, let's savor this meal. Veal here is so tender, and it's real Korean beef. Yes, boss.- Who the fuck are you?- Grab him. Who let them in? It's alright, sit, sit. Who the hell are you? Why are you ruining a perfectly fine breakfast for us? Can't you see we're eating here? It looks like you're almost done. Well, I'll be damned, it's lieutenant... Right, you got promoted. Chief KANG, our paths cross too much. You piece of shit. I'm getting tired of your mouth. This restaurant is a bit out of your league. Your salary won't even cover the dessert. Well, look at this... how can you eat this in the morning? Know your place in life. Chief KANG... It's long, bear with me. LEE Joong- go, you're charged with murder, fraud, assault, extortion, and... yadda yadda yadda. So damn much. It's too early for half- assed jokes. I'm not much of a joker. Are you really up for this? Think you can take me on? The charges won't stick. This is a court- certified warrant, we won't disappoint you this time. Take him away.- Boss!- Boss! Who was it, was it that fucker JUNG? I wonder, who could it be?- Boss, no!- Sir! Call a meeting. Okay, and I'll book the flight back. Is the file on chief KANG not ready yet? I made sure to have it for you when we arrive. And the Yanbian hobos? They should've arrived by now. Incheon International Ferry Terminal Try not to look like hicks too much. No need to be so obvious. We don't need extra attention.- You hear?- Okay. Let's get going! You see?! The Koreans sense these things! They already know we're Yanbians! Let's go! This is the face, fingers and toes. Hear his heartbeat? He's healthy. You'll feel the baby kicking from now on. You'll gain weight noticeably and... Should we... live abroad? Hello? Haven't received a report in weeks. There was nothing special.' Nothing special'? And other times were special? When does he get home, what he eats, how much he eats, does he snore or not, that stuff, I told you no detail is too small to leave out. Is your baby making you soft? Don't talk about my baby! I want to quit. Quit? You wanted this in exchange for your dope fiend father. We pulled you out of that bar and made you whole, shouldn't you be grateful? That dope fiend is dead, and Ja- sung was the one who saved me. Don't you worry, I'll live for him. Is that so? You think that's so easy? How would he feel if he knew you're spying for us? That thug would love that, won't he? Son of a bitch... Sure, but what can I do, this is my job. Do yours right, got it? The cops really went all out this time. Perhaps they really got enough dirt to prosecute. Yeah? Then who provided the dirt? You think I did this? I don't stoop that low. And I never had that kind of dirt. Is that so? Then who could it be? If not you, probably one of yours then. Your boy Ja- sung perhaps? Fucking traitor, this is how you do me? Keep me busy and take over the entire organization?- Yo, Joong- go...- Motherfucker! I'll fucking split your mouth! I'll fucking split your mouth, if you ever say my name again. Try me. Come at me all you want, see if you get your way. Our lawyer's doing his best, so sit tight. We greased enough of them over the years, it'll work out. Did you... offed the old man? It wasn't you? If not, it could've been one of the moles, or... Or? A thousand others. Eat this, you fucking chink. Yo JUNG. Please... watch your back. Thank you for thinking of me, even behind bars. You're really something... Bring it. It's a small token of my appreciation. What is it, something edible? It's Chinese mooncake, a real delicacy. Mooncake, huh? Come on, open it at home. How do you eat it? Like this? This doesn't look edible. It's laundered clean, there's no need to worry. I'll take good care of you. We'll send you a regular care package, consider it your retirement fund. You just have to back off and let us do our thing. Don't dig into our affairs too much.- Give me a smoke.- Yes, boss. What, don't like it? Need some more? Do you want a share of our earnings then? Hey JUNG Chung, what do you take me for? Take it back. I don't take money from gangsters. Then what do you want? You're not trying to wipe us out, so you must want something. Wipe you out? Someone else will take your place in no time. And start a new investigation? Too much hassle. We're not asking much from you. Just know your place, and do as you're told. No need to overreact to everything. So you want us to run errands for you dicks? Like fucking ball- less lapdogs? There's no need for that. Think of it as, a cooperative relationship.- Grab the cash.- Yes, sir. Alright, enough, go away! Okay, I hear you. I got your message loud and clear, you'll hear from me soon. It's chief KANG's personnel file, both professional and personal... Shut up! Is this accurate? I got it from one of the best Chinese hacker groups, these guys can infiltrate the FBI database in 2 days tops. And the Yanbian hobos? They're standing by. Incoming call- Bro My fucking bro! Where you at? When did you get in? Today? Why didn't you call? Of course it's not a problem. What surprise? Why there? Okay. Wasn't he due back in 2 days? It's not like him. To the Incheon warehouse. Yes, boss. Pull over. What would you like to do? Call in the hobos. I think my cover is blown. Wipe my file and clean this place. And please quit smoking. Take care. She killed the lights? Holy shit! You never said she had a gun! I wasn't told either, fuckwad! We still gotta keep her alive?- Yeah, that's the order.- Let's hang back. It's a six- shooter, she's got 3 bullets left. Hey retard! This isn't Yanbian! Didn't you hear the gunshots?! The cops will be all over this shit! Then what do we do? Let's just blitz her! Isn't that dangerous? Are we on a vacation? Let's move! He's waiting inside, sir. Why all the way here? You're here, a bit late though. Yeah, because of the rain and traffic. Suk- mu, you fuck. I told you to buy the newest GPS. You get realtime traffic info, motherfucker. That's how we got here. Bring it. Come! Yo bro. Wanna see what's inside that barrel? Give me a smoke. Tada! It's your chess teacher. Surprised? Pretty cute and a fuckable body too. Those juicy tits... Yo bro. Did you know? That cunt is a spy. A cop. She's a cop. Did you know that? No, I... I didn't. She's a strong one, that bitch. She won't talk no matter what. She's better than my boys, I'll give you that. But I already knew what I wanted to know, I figured I'd confirm it with her. This right here. I paid a fortune in China for this file. Check it out. Even I was shocked. Not just a mole, but a cop was part of our family. Go on, look. That cum stain beside her is chief KANG, he's the one barking up our asses. He was an instructor when she was at the Academy. So he was her mentor and shit. Probably popped her cherry. Read the next one. There's one more. That fucker there, really got me. Son of a bitch! Motherfucker! Yo bro! Shocked? These fuck- holes were playing you all this time. Shit, it's not cutting through! Chief KANG'll get the message, don't you think?- Yo Yanbians!- Yeah? Have some fun and toss her with the body. Okay. Let's go. When I'm through with you, you'll beg me for death. What? A booty call at this hour? You're violating my right to sleep. Got some news that'll wake you up. This better be good. A new board meeting is called. In 2 days, 5 pm. JUNG'll take the helm since you're in here. So, you're here to rub it in? Yeah, you useless piece of shit. What the fuck?! So useless that you lost everything to the chinks. Since when did the chinks take over Goldmoon? Didn't it belong to your clan? You were the rightful heir. I didn't know you cared so deeply for me. And who got me into this? If it weren't for you, this wouldn't have happened. Boy, we're cops. We get a report, we investigate, we find dirt, we arrest. That's our job. So who made that report? JUNG Chung, you've hit rock bottom. So what?! What do you want from me? Grind my knife? This is your best?! I'm LEE Joong- go! The almighty LEE Joong- go! JUNG Chung, that cocksucker. This is rat poison, no doubt about it. Sir? But I can't just let it pass. I can't sink alone. And this rat poison could be a blessing in disguise. Alright, I'll play along. I'll play- HOW did JUNG find out? Did you make a deal with him? I know I'm a lowlife, but not that low. I figured it was you. I thought you flipped. We had a case like that. A long time ago. Is that why you had Suk- mu on me? As an insurance? We put him there, but he didn't know about you. Son of a bitch. Don't be like that, it's almost over. There's nothing more to lose. Nothing's changed, we continue according to the plan. So what's the plan? The plan?! Who will you back between them? What?! JANG Su- ki, current vice chair of Goldmoon. You said he holds no power. He was the Jeil boss, but lost all power when the clans united as Goldmoon. At the time, Jeil was about to disband, and he's semi- retired. So he's perfect for us. We took care of him since the beginning so he's ripe, but he's so powerless that our help alone won't do. That's why he needs a capable running mate. A running mate? This is Goldmoon's COO LEE Ja- sung. He's from the same town as JUNG, and also a Chinese descendant. Will he just comply? He may have to betray JUNG later. I always wondered who my running mate was. With you, this may be a doable proposition. Ja- sung, let's go all the way. Son of a bitch! You two haven't worked it all out yet? Ja- sung, let's talk details later. What the fuck is this?! Use him to take over Goldmoon. You said this is the end, you said this was my last mission. Sir, I can't do this. You promised, you gave me your word! Don't you care what happens to me? Do I matter at all? There's no other choice. This is the safest path for you. You son of a bitch! Cut the bullshit! How do you think JUNG Chung found out? Our database was hacked last week. By the Chinese hackers. They targeted me, and stole top secret intel. They found Suk- mu, here too! They got everything. And your file was definitely included. How come you won't kill Ja- sung? Go over the Shanghai contract. I wiped all your files. Officer LEE Ja- sung does not exist. Only me and the director know about you. No one knows why JUNG decided to keep you, but it's a lucky break. It gave us the upper hand. JUNG Chung's finished, as of today. LEE's clan is on the move. Got a smoke? What the? Shit! Get him! Motherfuckers! Boss, you have to go! Let go of me, assholes! Kill'em all! Motherfuckers! Send them to hell! Hold them back! Stop them! You spineless fucks... Did Joong- go order the hit? Falling for the cops' tricks? You underestimated our clan, you backstabbing chink! Come at me, motherfuckers! Come at me! Do it! Move, move, move! Over here, asshole! Joong- go, that fucker finally stirred up a shitstorm. He dragged everyone into this mess. Him and Jaebum clan's finished. There's no other way around this now. Someone must step up and clean up this mess. Isn't that right, vice chair JANG? We tried our best but he won't make it. I'm sorry. What do we do, boss?- Where's HAN Joo- kyung?- She's... She's in recovery. I'm sorry about the baby. High levels of stress and sudden shock triggered this. It'd have been dangerous for her too. Now, Ja- sung just has to take over. He's a made man now. Shouldn't he thank us for this? When this is done, process my resignation. Are you drunk? Not that shit again. Who'll manage this operation if you leave? You made this case, this is your baby. I can't, I'm too dumb for this shit. Stupidity is your excuse? Fucking moron. Can't take it all back. No one can back out of this. Either we see it through, or die in the process, so there's no turning back. It's a goddamn shame we lost a few of our own, some sacrifices are needed to win a war. Can you keep him on our leash? It won't be so easy anymore. What can he do? He's a shrimp caught in our net. No, thanks. I quit. Who knew the passing of SEOK would be such a blessing! Indeed! Now that it's all behind us, SEOK, and his boys LEE and JUNG were way too uptight. It's a brand new era. Will JUNG's boys stay in line? They still got Ja- sung. Your worries are unfounded. I assure you, they won't act recklessly. I promised him the vice chair once I become the chair. That's a brilliant idea! Succeeding in accordance to the rank is the right thing.- This is great!- Very good! As a precaution, I brought my own men. Just enough muscle for a smooth transition. Don't you worry, I know where I stand. What can I do with a few men? Think of them as my entourage. Let's finish this drink and start swinging! I feel so terrible! Asking Goldmoon's vice chair to this shabby joint. What do you want? What do I want? Remember you're at my beck and call. Until another handler is assigned, report directly to me. I'm warning you, nothing's changed. You're a cop, don't forget. And submit a revised organization chart by next week. Emphasize new intel that you didn't have access to before. Got it? Especially the top brass, feds, and other suits on Goldmoon's payroll. One more thing, LEE will be released soon. What? Insufficient evidence. Let me be clear, don't touch him. I'm sorry about your baby. I mean it. Yeah. What? It doesn't look good. You should make necessary arrangements. Leave us. Let's go. Loosen up, you fuck. I'm not dead yet. Didn't think I'd see you again, so good to see you. Yo bro. You look like shit. It's time... to choose a side. Listen to me, asshole. You'll stay alive that way. What are you doing? Boss! Bro! You fucking idiot... What if... like a fucking miracle, I pull through? Think you can take on me? I left you a present in my office safe. Check it out later. Be strong, my brother. That's the only way for you to survive. Go away, I'm tired. I'll be damned... How low the almighty has fallen. Yes boss, he just got out. Ride with me, I want a word with you. Beautiful day, isn't it? He's a terrible driver. If you were me, wouldn't you do the same? KANG won't let this slide. What can he do? With you gone, he can only depend on me. Shall we? Let's get some air. Take care, send my regards to JUNG Chung. Give me a smoke if you got one. One last smoke isn't much to ask for, right? Today's the board meeting? Congratulate Ja- sung for me, who knew he'd sit on the throne. Rags to riches... What a beautiful day to die. HOW dare you?! What a twist. Hey, mister, you really have cab fare? Dammit! Fine, fine, don't touch! Which car? That one? Attention please. Our current vice chair and unanimous successor JANG Su- ki has decided to forfeit his candidacy for personal reasons. And LEE Ja- sung has been nominated for the chair. Any objections? This is an expensive car, it's not for your... Mister, pull up right beside it. What, what? Are you deaf? Beside that car. Oh, okay... Chairman LEE Ja- sung What was your name? LEE Ja- sung, sir. LEE Ja- sung... Born in Yeosu... Chinese descendant, right? Yes, sir. I got a job for you, one that's tailored for you. Sir? 6 years ago, Yeosu Come on, hurry up! Fuck, I gotta piss when I get nervous. You drank like a whore.- I'll be right back.- Goddammit! Shit, I got it on my pants.- Any plans later?- What do you think? What the fuck?! There's too many of'em. Who the fuck?! I'll fucking kill you! Give me a smoke. Let's clean up and go watch a movie. Which one? Porn, of course. Fuck\u201c. Let's go.

{"title": "Shetland Red Bones: Part 2", "content": "Who's there? Is that you?' I'm at my grandmother's croft!' I... I don't understand. She's been shot. She's dead. Has the gun been fired recently? Aye, I went out shooting rabbits after I got home. I'll need to take the gun. Can I help you?' Two families. The Wilsons and the Haldanes...' Jackie Haldane?'.. Related. Living on top of one another for generations...' We're all connected in one way or another on Shetland, aren't we? One big happy family.'.. One of them wealthy, one of them not.' Now, I can't believe that that hasn't created any tension. My boy wouldn't hurt anyone, let alone his own family. You should be asking yourself who inherits the land. It's Hattie James. I need to speak to you. Hattie? Hang on. My signal's going. Oh, good God!' Inspector?' Can you hear me? Hello? Did Hattie ask permission to work at the dig? No. I didn't know she was here. I was over at my croft all night. Well, I have to ask you this. Were you alone? Uh- huh, alone. I just want to know what happened to my mother and this girl, I don't need accusations. You might want to take a look at it before we whisk it down to Inverness. All the equipment's initialled, so stuff doesn't get mixed up. PB. And I'm guessing it's not Pierce Brosnan. Paul Berglund. Check these for prints as quick as you can. As far as I'm concerned, this is a suspicious death. Tape off the area and get Sandy to block the access road. It'll keep him busy. I'm going to head back to the main island. But, from the photos, she reckons blood loss, wounds probably self- inflicted. I'm just... I'm not sure. You see, the bruise on the arm, it could be someone held her. And she's got another one on the back of her head. She could have cracked it when she passed out. And these cuts? No reason why they couldn't be defensive. Self harmer? Her mother said she'd suffered from depression, didn't she? The lab got back. The only prints on the knife are Hattie's. What?! On a knife that numerous people must have used? That... that doesn't make sense! I mean, what if... the prints were wiped and then, the knife was put back into Hattie's hand after she was killed. Nah... Jimmy, this feels like suicide. Mima's death could have pushed her over the edge. Hello. Yes, he's just here, hang on. Who is it? Duncan. What would you say if I told you I just picked up that great wee engine for your boat?' I was going to call you...'' Sounds ominous. Go on.' Well, I was just thinking, you know, because I cannot think of one single person on these islands that you haven't done business with, because everybody likes you' and everybody respects you...' Where is this going? I'm thinking of requesting a banning order for Up Helly Aa.' On what grounds?' Public safety. I do not have the manpower. The festival will police itself. I've got two unsolved murders on my hands and I'm supposed to switch off all the streetlights in Lerwick.' No CCTV.' I'm supposed to open all the church halls.' And there's tourists jamming all the roads. Now, what do I do if something happens? What do you want me to do about it? I'm not on the Island Council.' But you know just about everybody that is.' So I'm thinking, you know, if you back me up, then, we might have a chance.' I'll see what I can do.' But Up Helly Aa has never been cancelled. Yeah, OK, great. Thanks for that. Bye. Excuse me! Have you heard? Yes. What a waste, such a talented girl. I've never understood suicide. The knife found by her body had the initials PB engraved on it. The knife was used to slash her wrists. Any reason why she might use your knife specifically? Was it symbolic? Is that what you mean? She was upset about a love affair and I just wondered... Professor, student. It happens. Yeah, I get the drift, Inspector. Uh- huh. But I want to make one thing clear- there was nothing going on between Hattie and myself. If there's a reason she took her life, it wasn't me. Gwen. I'm Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez. We spoke on the phone. I've got a car waiting for you over here. Are you the one who found her? Yes, I am. Yes. I need some fresh air. Can I get you anything? Apart from a brave face. You haven't got one of them, have you? In my family, we just got on with things. Not much for talking about our feelings. I never knew what to do about her mood swings. It's not easy being a parent. Nobody gets it right. Nobody. She had a breakdown. A couple of years ago. It was over some man. Somebody she was at work with. I thought she was on the mend. I really did. You don't think she killed herself, do you? Do you? It's possible there's another explanation. There's talk of a failed love affair a few years ago. Does she mention anything about that? No. Berglund comes up a lot in her posts. Thanks. Having had one or two fruitless crushes on older men, I'd say she was a bit in love with him. You think? And he's always messaging her. He said they hardly knew each other. Not sure about that. Check out her photos. Not only did he know her, I've a feeling it was in the biblical sense as well. Professor Berglund's been telling porky pies. Hello, Tosh! Drew. Don't bother being nice to her. You had your chance. Is Berglund here? He's gone out. Sorry. Is something bothering you? I just don't like being lied to, that's all. See, look, there. Berglund's car. Do you mind? Hello. You told me that you'd never worked with Hattie before this project. So who's that, your twin brother? She was volunteering on a dig I was supervising. I thought you might misinterpret the situation. Try me. We had a brief fling. I was away from my family. Hattie was beautiful and... available. What I didn't realise was... how needy she could be. Were you still sleeping with her at the time? No. You think it's significant she used my knife to kill herself. You're wrong. I didn't say she killed herself, Professor. Was Hattie threatening to tell the university about your affair? Cos sleeping with a student is a no- no. I mean, you would lose your funding overnight if that got out. It was over. It was! I don't know what you're looking at her for? She's young enough to be your daughter, man. Hattie did all these. They're all objects that were found at the dig. Except for that one. Freya, the protector of lovers. Well, you better hope she's looking out for you two, cos you're going to need her. What's the score with the drawing of the pendant? Why's it with the stuff from the dig? Because Hattie thought it belonged there. Yeah. I knew I'd seen it before. What? The Norwegian, Per Lungstad, he's wearing the pendant that Mima gave Hattie.' You think Mima and this Norwegian spy were lovers?' Well, he gave her a pendant, the Norse goddess of love, and she kept it for 70 years. Yeah... Drew never gave me anything like that. Although he did write my name in the sand on the beach at Scalloway. Spelt it wrong, though. He can't spell Tosh? Alison. Honest to God, Alison. You're better off without him. Yeah. That goddess of love is certainly being kept busy, isn't she? What are you talking about? Aye, almost as busy as Mr Berglund. Whatever she's saying, he's not liking it. You know, you can see Ronald and Anna's place from Mima's croft. If there was anything going on between the two of them, what's the betting Mima knew about it? Should we spoil the party? No. Sometimes it's good to keep your powder dry, Tosh. It's crowded up there. Just got the pathologist's report. You were right. Foul play. Tosh, check with the Norwegian Embassy. See if you can get a record of all the agents that used the Shetland bus. And I want the names of all the men that went missing. Cassie. I'm not staying in again tonight. Look, Cass. A young girl got killed last night. Until I know why, you're going nowhere. I can't wait for this to be over. What? My childhood! Can I at least go over to Duncan's? Mary needs a hand making food for Up Helly Aa. Sure. I'll drop you. Bye. Bye. Who's this? Gwen James wants to know when she can take her daughter's body back home. I told her not for a few days. OK. I got an email from the War Museum in Bergen. It's the list of the Norwegian agents lost during the Shetland Bus operations. Look. Per Lungstad. It seems to me he was a bit of a hero. He did far more trips than any other sailor. How did he die? It was reported he drowned during a crossing. They never found a body. They moved a lot of money between Britain and Norway via the bus. Does it say if he had any money on him? About a 100, 000 Norwegian Krone when he disappeared. I'm guessing you could get quite a lot of pickled herring for that back then. Shouldn't you be looking after the croft? I need to do something more, especially now my father is a suspect. What do you mean? His name is on your incident board. Do you really think my father could kill his own mother. If he did, he wouldn't be beating up cousin Ronald for the same crime, would he? Who said he beat up Ronald? Crossed your mind though, didn't it? Look, I'm not arguing with you about this. OK? My dad needs to know what happened. It's eating him alive. I can see it in his eyes. I'm worried about him. If it helps, I'll go over and see him tomorrow. Tell him how the investigation is going. Put his mind at ease. How's that? Now, go home. But I'll need you in tomorrow to keep an eye on the festival. And it'll be a long shift. OK? OK. Thank you. Hi. Cassie ready? I didn't realise you were picking her up. She's gone. Said she was meeting some friends in town. What's up? Did she say where? Market Cross. Don't worry about her, Jimmy. She'll be fine. I've got two murdered women on my hands that thought they were going to be fine. Oh, hey! Calm down. You're overreacting. Cassie will be all right! The island's not safe, not until I say it is. OK. You want me to come with you? No. You're fine. Hey, Ronald. What do you want? Are you OK? Should you not get home before you get yourself in more trouble? I don't have a home! I don't have a wife! I don't have a family! I've nothing! All right, you calm down. Calm down or I'm going to arrest you. Get in the car. I said get in the car. What's happened? Anna's left me. That's what happened. But she's going to regret that. And so's the bastard she's been shagging! Careful with the threats, Ronald. Remember who you're talking to. Where did you find him? Uh? Oh! Market Cross. Listen, you haven't seen Cassie on your travels, have you? No. No? Here. Drink that. You need to be thinking clear. The booze is only going to make things worse. For everyone. I tried to make her happy. It's not like I wanted to be away from home. I did it for her. And this is how she repays me. You know who the other man is? Aye, that guy who runs the dig. Do you know who I mean? Uh- huh. I'll just be two minutes. Have you got anything in your pockets? What's the charge? There's no charge. He just needs a wee bit of\" me time\". Ronald? Are you gambling? These slips add up to thousands. Another reason for her to leave me, I suppose. Has this got anything to do with why you were attacked or why you were so sure it wasn't Joseph? You owe people? Who? Duncan Hunter. Cassie? Come here, you. Your Dad's looking for you. Suck this. And if you want my advice, stick to vodka, you can't smell it. That was a joke, by the way. Come on. Right, where the hell have you been?! You knew I didn't want you going out on your own, but yet, you did it anyway! I said I'd meet them. How do you think it would look if I didn't turn up? Nothing was going to happen to me. You don't know that! You don't know cos you don't know what people are capable of! You hungry? OK, so Berglund was having an on- off affair with Anna, and also with Sophie, and possibly Hattie. I'm surprised he's got the strength to pick up a trowel. I suppose if you're going to be addicted to something, it might as well be sex. Anyway, Mima must have seen him coming and going, so what if Anna knew she knew? Gives her a motive. Otherwise, she loses the Haldane money. OK... Just so you know... your man is down in the cells. He hasn't done anything stupid, has he? What do you mean? Like going out shooting rabbits drunk as a skunk in the middle of the night? No, nothing like that. Oh, God! But he did happen to mention your domestic situation. I'm not here to judge you. It can't have been easy moving all the way up here just to find yourself on your own for weeks on end while your man's out at sea. And then, when he does show his face, it's always at the end of a bottle. Now, with the baby, it's a difficult situation. I'm not surprised you feel neglected. Along comes a man like Paul Berglund. If I was in your situation, I would probably have a go at him myself. The problem I have is that Mima Wilson must have known about your affair. Because it would have been hard for her to miss it. And then, the question I have to ask myself is what part, if any, that played in her death? Look, I know what you're getting at, but Mima wasn't going to say anything about Paul and me. She knew an unhappy marriage when she saw one. Meaning? It was clear she never married again because she was so unhappy with Jerry Wilson. She almost seemed relieved he died young. Now... you know that if it does turn out that Mima threatened to reveal your affair, it gives you a motive for murder. There's a lot of money at stake. I don't care about the Haldane money. I never have. You know, I wish Mima had told Ronald about us. I would've thanked her. I didn't have the courage to do it myself. When did it start? Last year. When he came up for the first dig. Before you got pregnant? So that is why he looked so uncomfortable? He didn't know? Didn't know what? Ah, come on... That he's the father of your baby, not Ronald. I made a mistake marrying Ronald. But it doesn't have to ruin my life, does it? You know, all I want is a fresh start. With Paul Berglund? That's not going to happen. Here, come on. Have some of that. Ah, takes me back. This could be you one day. No. Hello. Right, I'll be two minutes. OK. So, how long have you been taking illegal bets? You know me. I'm always looking for a new project. It was just a bit of fun. How much does Ronald owe you? Three grand. You should have told me! Well, as you just pointed out, it is slightly illegal. Yeah, but do you not see my point? Ronald's got a motive now. He needs money, he needs it quick. He could have gone to Mima's to rob her. Why would he? Jackie'll bail him out. And what if she said no? I hope you don't think I had him duffed up. Cos, truth be told, there's a queue from here to Aberdeen waiting to take a swing at him. Your days as a bookie are over. OK? Is everything all right with Cassie? Eh? Aye, she's fine. I was wondering... how she feels about me and Mary starting a new family? I mean, has she said anything to you? No. She likes Mary. Oh, but me, not so much. No, eh... I'm sure she resents me for walking out when she was a baby. Well, I know she does. She feels rejected. That's natural. But she needs us both. You did the right thing coming back. But I don't think it's going to be as easy as you think. When did I say it was going to be easy? I'll... I'll see you later. Aye. Cass. Uh- huh? Here. Cass... you know, if you ever want to talk to me about stuff, you know, how you feel about Duncan, stuff like that, you can. You know, you won't hurt my feelings. OK. Cos I'd much rather you spoke to me about it than bottled it up. Fine. So? Two dads are better than one? Always with the jokes, huh? OK, if you must know. I feel trapped sometimes. I feel so far away from everything. I know, I felt like that, I couldn't wait to get away from here. Now, I couldn't imagine living anywhere else. It's been the longest two years of my life. You were born here. I know. But it just seems a bit weird to stay in the same place all the time. If God had wanted us to do that, he wouldn't have invented TripAdvisor, would he? What am I actually supposed to do? There's no decent shops, the Internet's dead slow. I mean, if I was a tomboy, I'd climb a tree, but we don't have any. You know you'll be at university before you know it. In the meantime, start collecting shells or something. That's mine! Come on! Any chance of a bacon roll? It's no bed and breakfast, Ronald. And if I was you, I would stop drinking. You're a better man sober. So do you think I killed Mima? Some people are capable of anything with a drink in them. Now, gone, get away home. Three cheers for the Galley builders! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! You take the harbour, I'll stay near the Market Cross. OK? You're the boss. Hi, Tosh, it's me. I'm on the ferry back to Bressay. I just want to make sure you keep an eye on things. Oh, what is it now? Per Lungstad? Mima ever talked to you about him at all? You see, you know what I think, I think Mima thought it was him that they dug up and she was upset about it. And, actually, you were upset about it as well, weren't you? Cos you stopped the dig.\" Let whoever is buried here rest in peace,\" that's what you said. Who's buried up there? What changed your mind, Joseph? Who is buried up there? Because you know, don't you? It was my father they found. Jerry? Jerry was drowned at sea. Jerry Wilson was not my real father. So... Per was your father? Aye. Mima thought the skull was his. Now, what else did she tell you? She... She said that... She said that Jerry found out about her and Per. He was in a rage. He told her that he'd given Per 24 hours to get off the island. And what about the money? The money that Per had on him to take to Norway. I... I don't know. When did she tell you this, when? The day she died. I think she'd kept it secret for as long as she could, but now that it was all going to come out, she just wanted me to know the truth. Why didn't you tell me this? This is nobody's business but mine. But you must have been angry... after being lied to for all those years. Are you telling me you didn't lose your temper? I did not harm my mother. Well, then, where were you the night she died? Because you weren't in Lerwick. I need to know, Joseph. I need to know you didn't do this. I was out on my boat. All night. I couldn't tell you cos I've already been out 15 days fishing. That's my quota for the month. You're saying you lied to me because you were black landing? I need the money. Boats like the Cassandra are killing us. Ronald's not here, if that's who you're looking for. He'll be over on the main island, for the burning. It's your father I've come to talk to. About what? Well, it's not the EU fishing quota, Jackie. Just so you know, he's had another fall. He will keep trying to get out of his chair. You're not feeling your best today, Andrew? Oh, could be worse. I wanted to talk to you about the old days, about the Shetland Bus. You fit for that? You and Jerry Wilson worked together? Aye. The Scalloway men repaired the boats. But when the navy wanted crew, they came to us. We were just boys, but the best sailors on the islands. And you moved men and supplies back and forth? Aye. And money? Aye. What about the Norwegian who was passing information to the Germans? What about him? He got some of our boys captured. The Germans executed them. We were very angry. You remember his name? My memory isn't what it was. Was it Per Lungstad? It might have been. Cos you boys meted out some rough justice, or so they say. I wouldn't know about that. No. No, you wouldn't. Cos that's not true. Is it? Per Lungstad wasn't a traitor. Mima was having an affair with him, wasn't she? Well, if she was, it's a secret she's taken with her to the grave. I wouldn't be too sure about that, Andrew. You know what I think? I think Jerry killed Per in a jealous rage. And I think you helped him to dump the body, maybe... even helped to kill him. Not true! And Jerry, what happened to Jerry? What happened to him? We were fishing. The weather turned. A wave washed him over. I tried to hold onto him. But I lost my grip. And what about the money Per had on him? After Jerry was gone, that was all yours, wasn't it? You used it to buy your first fishing boat. You were 19. And look at you now, eh? The proud owner of the Cassandra, worth what, ten million? Your fortune is built on stolen money. Even if that was true, who would care about it now? Mima. She saw her lover had been murdered and one of the men that killed him lived in the big house across the hill. What did she do, did she threaten to ruin you? Cos all she had to do was pick up a phone. You couldn't silence her on your own, so you got somebody else to do it for you. Was it Ronald? Leave him alone! Can't you see he's struggling? OK, it's all right. Breathe. Why are you doing this to us? Ronald had nothing to do with Mima's death, nothing. You can't be sure of that, Jackie. It was a robbery. Some incomer. You said yourself they smashed a window, pulled out the phone! The answer to Mima's death lies in the past. And you and your father know it. What did you say to him? What did you tell him? Yeah?' Tosh, it's me.'' I want you to find Ronald Haldane and bring him back in,' I'm not finished with him yet.' Yeah, right. Fine, I'm on it. Don't involve Sandy, use another uniform. What did Jimmy Perez want? Uh? All these years, you've sat up here, looking down on us, haven't you? Well, now, you're going to tell me the truth. What did Perez want?! He thinks Ronald killed your mother! Billy, radio Sandy, he's not answering his phone, and I need to speak to him. I've had Inverness on. They're sending up a forensic team and a DCI to take over the investigation. Apparently, we're not getting anywhere fast. Tosh, you picked up Ronald yet? No. I can't see him anywhere. The place is mobbed. Well, they're going to turn the streetlights off at seven, so just keep looking for him. You... I'm sending a copy of my report to your university. So if I was you, I'd start looking for another job. What is it, Joseph? Uncle Joseph! Sandy! When you found Mima's body, you said the landline was unplugged. That's right, isn't it? I think so. I noticed that when I went to call the hospital. I plugged it back in. Have you told anyone in the family about this? No. Are you sure. Nobody? No, nobody. Jimmy, I just saw Ronald going into the Fish Market. Joseph Wilson's away in after him.' I think you better get over there.' OK, I'll check it out. Listen, I want you to issue an arrest warrant for... Never mind. You're coming with me, now. What do you think you're doing? You want to help your son? Now's your chance! Tosh, Ronald's at the fish factory, I want you to go over there as quick as you can. I'm on my way. Joseph! You think you were going to get away with this? Did you? Did you, eh? Joseph! I never thought someone could do that to one of their own. Never! Never! Joseph! Put the knife down! He's getting what he deserves. Joseph, put down the knife. Put it down! Don't make things any worse than they already are! I'm not letting him get away with it! I'm going to mark him, mark him for life... so everyone, EVERYONE will remember what he did. He didn't kill Mima. He'd nothing to do with it! Did he, Jackie? Go on! Tell him who killed Mima. Tell him! Tell him! That night... after we found the skull, Mima called. She was angry. She said my father would die in prison. Made crazy accusations about the past, about where our money came from. I didn't know what she was on about. But when I looked into my father's eyes, I knew it was all true. I had to protect him. Don't you see? We'd lose everything. Dad would have to go into some care home. I couldn't let Mima do that to us. I couldn't. And Hattie? Hattie came to see me... and she said Mima's lover was buried near the croft. I couldn't let her find the body. I followed her. I didn't want to hurt anyone. But I had to put an end to this. You have to protect your family. You know that, Joseph. Family comes first. WE are family. Tosh. Jackie Haldane, I'm arresting you for the murders of Mima Wilson and Hattie James. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if... If you do not... I know it- if you do not mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court. Should I bring in Andrew Haldane? And charge him with what? I just wanted to say that I thought your daughter was lovely. She could empathise with people and see the world from their point of view. And, unfortunately, that made her vulnerable. But it also made her care. And I wish there were more people like her. You should be very proud of her. I am. I always will be. Safe trip. Is that who I think it is? Yep. It's the mainland DCI and his team. I thought you told them we didn't need them. I thought you did. Shit. You still think this is the best place in the world to live? Yep, of course I do. I mean to say, on a clear day, you can see Norway over that way. There is that. And... you can see Iceland over that way. The shop? I forgot, we don't have one of them. Or a McDonald's. Uh- huh. Or a Marks& Spencer. Uh- huh. We've got the sky and the sea, and razorbills and kittiwakes. What more do you want?

{"title": "Marvel's Avengers Assemble Ghost of a Chance", "content": "Come on, Falcon, push it. You're running out of time.- Tony?- Hello. I hate it when you do that. I know. What's in the box? A bomb? Let me jet it into the exosphere for you. It's not a bomb. Rare vaccine for a plague- stricken village?- No.- Huh. Well, it must not be very important then. Tony! No. Really? Now, you've got me interested. Will you quit it? I'm nervous enough as it is. For what? Move- in day? Sam, I had your stuff shipped in hours ago. The morning briefing. We're 10 minutes late. Seriously? No, I never get to those things on time. Takes Cap half an hour just to make coffee.- Huge yawn.- That's you. I'm new. Do I look calm? You've got wing- pit stains. Sam, relax. You're here for a reason. Trust me, everyone is very cool at these things. Strategically, the Hulk has six options that we've trained for. Sorry I'm late. What's in the box, little bird? My mom made cookies. A little embarrassing. Uh, she didn't want me to show up empty- handed. Keep them coming. The Son of Odin shall have that cookie! Hands off! Say goodbye. Avengers!- Who are you?- Falcon. New guy. We kicked the Red Skull and MODOK's butts together. Ah, that Hawkeye sense of humor. Don't quit your day job. Or he woke up on the wrong side of the man- cave. Either way, ignore him. This still doesn't feel real. Oh, it'll be very real once we go through all of the official stuff.- I'll teach you the secret handshake.- There's a secret handshake? Note to self,\" Does not get sarcasm.\" You're loving every minute of watching me geek out, aren't you? A little. Here's your quarters. Home- sweet... home?- This is my room?- Yeah, I know, but I was working late in the lab and I needed space. So do I. Unless you know how to juggle unstable particles without tearing a hole in the universe, it's gonna have to wait. This time I'm not kidding. So what do I do if moving in is on hold? You're an Avenger now. So go on, new kid, mingle. Maybe I should move the unstable particles instead. I'm here to pop something else. More cannot come across until we secure the portal. There's one more than we planned for.- Will the human impede our progress?- No, he's insignificant. Distract him until we can bring over our brethren.- Thor's room.- So, I just walk in?- He doesn't bite.- He has a hammer. Asgardian inter- dimensional decorating. That's all I got until I figure it out. I hate it when I don't know things. Don't worry, Bilgesnipes love to wrestle. Especially on Earth. We're gonna see who else is available.- You just go on with your Viking thing.- I am not a Viking! Hawkeye is always good for a fight. Let's see what he's up to. Falcon, have you more cookies? Okay. For a guy with perfect aim, he can't hit a garbage can, can he? Where is he? In the lab. I swear, if he's making popcorn again... I gotta go. Try Hulk. He's a great sparring partner. Me, spar the Hulk? Now, I know you're kidding. Squashed by a humongous green foot. Not how I thought I'd go out. Maybe I'll just go a few rounds with JARVlS. Like, at chess. Why, Natasha, who knew you were the glass animal type. Cute. Huh? To the right. We don't talk about this... ever. I was about to start a round of training. You want in? With you? Yes, definitely, now. Enthusiasm, nice.- How do you like the tower so far?- Not what I expected. JARVlS, respond. I didn't program you to take coffee breaks. Gentlemen, did someone call a meeting of the Break Tony's Stuff Committee? We do not play with the big boy equipment in the House of Stark. Oh, boy. Good. But don't stay so focused on the forward drive that you forget your flanks. Would it be totally wrong to say how surreal this is? I just want to fit in. But I feel like any minute somebody's gonna say,\" April Fools'.\" What you're feeling is totally normal, Sam. But don't worry, Truth is... Thanks, that means the... Wait. What? Fly home, birdie. While you still can. Cap. I don't... I may be having first- day jitters, but that's not Cap. Tony, something weird is going on. Tony? Aah! Black Widow, you too? Great, maybe MODOK and Skull are up to their body- swapping tricks? Heard you wanted to spar. Someone want to tell me what's going on here? Get down! Hurry, we're compromised. Throw the switches. We're locking down the tower. I was really hoping this was like a prank for my first official day on the job. The exploding cake was going to be the prank. This is an invasion. Exploding what? Switch your heads- up display to ultraviolet. Tony! How does he say it? Oh, yes. Hulk smash.- What are these things?- If I knew, they'd be gone. Surprise. Don't hold back. It isn't mind control. That's some kind of copy.- Like a clone?- It's beyond cellular. Every atom in his body has been displaced by an identical packet of dark energy. Displaced as in sent somewhere else? Where? You'll learn soon enough. Now, brother! Huh? Falcon's nothing. Finish him quickly so we can bring the others across. Others? There are more of you? If that wasn't so unpleasant, I'd be really impressed. Mind explaining what's so impressive about it? An alien life form that has no body, copies one, and then sends the original away apparently to a dark matter dimension? That's pretty elegant for a parasite. Some days I'm glad I'm not a super genius. I'd rather just be mad someone hacked into my body. We've been watching the hostile takeover from these windows. Probably how they studied us. A small trans- dimensional rift. And that, Mr. Genius? That is very bad. Hulk, do your thing. Been doing it! They don't smash! Don't even make any noise. Uh, you sure? Because I hear something. Come on. Come on. They're all gone. It's only me. All me. Finances. Automation. Finances. Finances? All that money and you couldn't afford to give me a bigger room? Bingo, surveillance archives. Limbo? Do not investigate. Yeah, my room. He cracked open a door. Now they want to kick it down and bring more through. For an insignificant human, you've been quite annoying. Not annoying, I'm avenging. In case I actually survive this, I don't want the real Hulk to kill me. We've absorbed life forms in countless dimensions. So rich with life, so many forms for our brethren to assimilate. And the Avengers were the only force that could have stopped you so we were the first to be assimilated. We're just trying to fit in. You know how that feels. Whatever. We will stop you.- There is no\" we.\"- Huh? Nice try. We can mimic organic and tech materials. This armor is identical to the original. But the guy inside is just a cheap copy who doesn't know the braking flap override is right here.- He'll bring reinforcements.- Let him. By the time they come, we'll need the bodies. Repulsors don't affect them. But fists do. Our ethereal bodies are on the same vibrational plane as theirs. Finally, something I can smash! Why are they all attacking us? Didn't we get jumped already? We can handle a few space Phantoms. Space Phantoms, seriously, that's what we're calling them?\" Creepy ugly bad dudes\" wasn't a better suggestion, Hawkeye. I do not care what they're called, they will fall. They're not here for us. They're here for that. We've established the dimensional bridge. The rest of our brethren amass on the other side. What's the delay? The barrier is more resilient than expected. We need more energy to punch through. Did someone say\" punch\"? I'm shutting down your dimensional doggie- door. Go on, brave little bird. Shut the portal and trap your team in limbo. Forever. They're alive? Sam! You're hardly even worth assimilating. Though I'm sure someone will take you. No! Portal is open, folks. You know what to do. Stupid purple ghosts! Avengers, do whatever you have to. Keep those things from entering our world. Hey, space freaks. Never underestimate an Avenger! Insignificant. Redwing mode. Toys won't help you. He's using his redwing to create a vortex. He's pulling those Phantom Avengers right at us. Wish I would have thought of it. Does this make Falcon officially smarter than you? Considering he survived the longest and got the Phantoms out of the tower? It's not over yet. Falcon, what do we need to know about these guys? They have your strength, your equipment. But they don't have your skills. I'll show you skills. No brains either. That wasn't very smart, soldier. Let's be civil about this. You do civil. I'll do angry! Hulk, a little help? What good is a simple hammer? Other questions? Ugh. Nice breath! Stark, energy blasts work on our doubles. Oh, that's cool. I'll figure out the science later. For now, badoosh. Please, tell me my breath doesn't smell that bad. I may be a super spy, but even I'm not that good a liar. Think I'm nothing, huh? Just remember who put you back here. We need to shut this door. Hulk, quit playing around and give us some elbow room. Works for me. You should do the honors. Shut it down.- Shut it down?- You're right, blow it up. Thank you. That was about your room, wasn't it? I'll have the stuff moved out. After today, you're building me a bigger room. Off the helipad. You can afford it. Way to rub his nose in it.

{"title": "Dag Cold Turkey", "content": "- Everything under control?- Yes.- What's that?- The bucket? Benedikt said he was uncomfortable. He's coming because I begged him. And he tends to overcompensate. Yes, last time was special. But what's with those? The place mats? A psychological trick. If people sense children are around, they tend to behave.- We might not even need the bucket.- Good.- What is it?- Nothing. You get that, I'll check the food.- Hi. You forget that I don't drink?- No, not at all.- Am I late?- No, Marianne isn't here yet.- I'm glad you could make it.- I'm a no- no- yes man. I always say no first, then build my way up to a yes.- But you have to start with a no?- Yeah. Just so I don't feel guilty.- Into the inner sanctum?- Yes.- And this is my seat?- Say good night to Uncle Benedikt and Dag. See you tomorrow. We'll fry some bacon. Lovely. Good night.- You're getting good at it.- At what? Being a father. Sure. Except to my own child.- Bad luck. Trine is...- Let's talk about something else. Is that bucket there because of last time? That was a different version of me. Incapable of saying no. I still go on benders, but tonight is about survival. Is it that bad? I have absolutely nothing. No home, job or visitation rights, no self- respect or will to live. Look on the bright side. It can't get any worse. I'll leave the bucket, just in case.- Need some help?- Please. If you grab there, I'll grab here. How many dead animals have passed through here? This is the elephant's graveyard of pigs and turkeys. They come here to be the focal point of a culinary experience. Just a tiny taste.- A tad more salt?- Yeah!- Have you heard from Marianne?- Not yet.- No text message?- No. We can't leave him in there alone.- Ready?- I've got it. Yes. Wow! You need any help?- No, we're good.- This is so impressive! All those drugs, yet he managed to produce 60 albums in 23 years! That's like running a marathon on a quart of liquor. I heard Elvis was prescribed 5000 pills during his last seven months. Do the math! Have you downed anything else, besides that bottle? I took a Valium. I was uncomfortable, so... You know that feeling. I'll call Marianne. Something tells me we should eat pretty soon. I know it's hopeless, but could you try to take it easy? This evening needs to go well We've hit a rough patch. And I have a... surprise. Marianne can't make it, so... She's here now.- Her boyfriend was still...- Her boyfriend? Well, it isn't me. I'm right here. Hi. Can I help you? That's OK. Would you like to come in? No, no. If you're a friend, I insist you come in. We're just about to eat. And let me apologize for our inebriated guest. He's very nice, but rather fond of girls. She said she was a friend of yours. So I figured... Is something wrong? No. Well, this is... Who is this, actually? This is... Juanita. She understands Norwegian because her mother is Danish. Oh, so she's told you that? How nice of you to decide to understand Norwegian today.- Am I missing something here?- No, I just... Well... Why don't you have a seat? Shit... How do you know Eva? That's great. I'll give Eva a hand.- Nonsense.- You have to stay! Could I borrow our guest for a minute? Keep walking. Do you know what's going on? No. But I'm not exactly in touch with my feelings right now. Valium isn't exactly a road map on how to read a room. But isn't she incredibly cute? Gorgeous? What the hell do you want? The son you told me to go to hell with? The one you chose not to keep? What's his name? What's his name?! I figured as much. Now you've seen him. Is everything all right? Let's eat. There you go. The turkey was delicious. Fantastic. Anyone up for a little... Are you familiar with Norwegian liquor? It may seem a little harsh...... if you haven't tasted it before. Of course! I'm a huge fan of girls who like to drink. I like people who can hold their liquor. Gravy? How did you find me? My address is unlisted. I transferred your phone to this address. You're not great at paying bills, so I figured I could take car of that. Cheers! Cheers. Excuse me. I just need to... I have never heard anything so condescending!\" Not great at paying bills\"? Why don't you explain this instead? This is... Leon's father. Yes, his name is Leon!- So... Her? You?- Yup. Back then you wanted nothing to do with him, and now it's too late! But you're a girl. No, he's equipped with a good- sized dick. And balls. That's right. You got rid of them. Do you still think I need taking care of?- Nah...- So you've had the operation? The dick. Right. So her penis has been inside you? That's how it tends to work, Dag. This is one great party! I'm loving it. Another shot? Always room for one more. Look at that! A manicure.- Christ!- Look! This say a lot about how a girl takes care of herself in general.- Benedikt, don't...- It's a compliment! Compliments make the world a better place. Complimenting people on their car or house is expected. But with the body, it takes on other connotations. You, for example Dag, have great calves. You do. And Juanita here-- has lovely, delicate, feminine hands.- My pleasure. See?- I think it's time for more wine.- White or red?- White. We should be allowed to say things... I think I'll go out and inspect the wine list, OK?- What are you doing?- Doing? She's extremely cute, Dag!- But she isn't...- I'm in love. I'm head over heels in love. An hour ago, I had nothing. For a brief moment last night I actually considered downing the rest of my Valium-- You...- I'm serious. It may sound corny, but remember those teen crushes? When just biking by a girl's window would make your heart race? Just knowing that she was in there? That' show I feel know. I can't remember feeling like this in ages. What were you going to say?- Nothing.- You sure?- You said you had a surprise?- Now's not the time. Come on. I'll be fun. Last time you didn't act, you end up in rehab. Surprises are always fun! Fuck it! This is really delicious. Hi, Dag.- Eh...- What is it? Well, I just... I thought... You're acting very strange, Dag. I expected my sister to be here. But the atmosphere has been a little weird tonight. And so I figured maybe it's a good time after all. Maybe it's good that the mood is weird. Christ, I am way outside my comfort zone right now. Will you marry me? What the fuck...? That was... That was a surprise. Eva?- Benedikt, could you get that? I can still do cartwheels!- Look!- No, no, no! Dag's probably just been housecleaning. Let me get the door. Eva? Is something wrong? Did I do something wrong? OK. Shit...- My brother!- Hello, sis. This is Derussey, my boyfriend. OK. All right. Have a seat.- Where is Eva?- Eva is... in the bathroom.- Would you like some wine?- Please. He's a marijuana grower.- Fantastic stuff.- I see. I think it's about time to retire.- Do you have to go?- Mhm. Sorry we're so late. Are you OK? Can I walk you somewhere? I've lived more in the last year than in my previous 35.- And is this Oompa Loompa your guru?- Him? No! He's only part of it. And he's incredibly well- hung.- Incredibly...?- Well- hung. It took some time for my body to adapt. I couldn't wear a bikini. I was so open, I whistled like a pan flute. OK?- When he's way deep inside me...- We're leaving now.- Yeah, OK.- So, thank your for this evening. Goodbye. Do you have any chocolate? I get the munchies from... You can check if I have anything in the kitchen.- You still have insomnia?- I never sleep much.- Let me have a Tolvon.- A Tolvon? Sure. Excellent. Thanks. I'm going to bed.

{"title": "Workaholics The Future Is Gnar", "content": "Hi. I'm comedian Tom Green with a special one- time offer. Say yes now and receive a case of premium Canadian sausage for only$39. 99. Daddy, would you like some sausage?- Yes.- [ Beep ] Magnificent. Now please enter your credit card info using your touch- tone phone.- [ Beep ]- And there you have it. Telecom intelligence negotiating algorithm, or\" Tina,\" gives callers two offers in a variety of celebrity voices, as you just heard. Tom Green? You should have got Scott Caan. Shut up, he's a huge celebrity.- Whoa, yeah.- Watch it. Someone needs to put a muzzle on him,-'cause I hate you.- Uh, real question. If Tina is making the calls, why are we here? Well, if Tina doesn't make the sale within the first two offers, then... Oh, I get it. Then we come in and clean bat up.' Cause this cold machine lacks the soft touch of a human... touching a machine. It lacks human error. And Tina persists where you would feel intrusive. Okay, so what's the catch? Well, if Tina does make the sale before your assistance is needed, you don't get the commission.- Just your hourly.- What? Is this a joke? Uh, you know, I- I get it. Gonna be less work for us, and we're still getting paid hourly. Exactly, thank you, stretch. No, you don't get it! This is just the beginning, guys. All right, if we let these machines take our jobs, next... next, they're gonna take everything. Okay, Blake, you're overreacting. Overreacting? I'm pretty sure that I'm right now. [ Intensely ] Just imagine a future... Where robots replace humans, evolving to be faster, smarter, and just way more freaking doper. [ Helicopters buzzing ] Where humans become obsolete, and they're forced by their ruler, Tina, to undergo a cyborg surgery known as orientation. And it'll only be a matter of time before they come for us all. Congrats, your bum will soon be on your very own Swedish massage chair. Now please enter your credit card info using your touch- tone phone.- Swedish.- Wow. Cool. Another sale stolen by Tina. And another one of our commission checks stuffed into the pockets of Tina's real comfortable cyber wranglers. Oh, yeah, just face it. Tom Green is Freddy- got- finger- raping us all day.- Yeah.- Oh, dude, check this out. Look what I snuck past the last merry maids sweep.- Thank God.- [ Laughs ] That huff, huff... Huffy white heat.- Huff! Huff!- Except for it's not hot.- It's actually very cold, so...- It's cold. Just be careful with it, all right?- [ Can sprays ]- Pretty cool, I guess.- [ Phone ringing, Tina answering ]- Ooh!- [ Coughs ]- That's crispy. [ Stammers ] That's a nimbus cloud in there. I've actually done so much of this stuff, I don't even think it really affects my brain anymore. Is that right? [ Can sprays, stops ]- [ Incoherent mumbling ]- Hey, but don't hog it all. I know it's gonna sizzle- fry my brain, but, I'm sorry, this whole impending doom thing is really getting to me, so if I could just have a huff of the hot... uh... The heat? Well, you know, it's... Just abandon all hope here. [ Buzzers sounding ] What the heck? What'd you do, man? I didn't do anything. Mm. [ Stammers ] We didn't do anything! Good. That's the way I like it. But that's all about to change. So, you've finally come to have me slave away in your vagina, as your sex slave. That's fine. I'll have sex with you. But I will never love you, Alice. I will never love you! Step aside, you troll. Oh, good one: Troll.- Yeah, right.- I'm here for Blake. Oh,'cause of his hair?' Cause you're into trolls? No. Because it's time for his orientation. Oh, fuck, sorry. Alice, please, I haven't even lived yet, all right? I didn't even get to try Carl's Jr.' s CrissCut fries.- Seriously?- Yeah, you know. I'm an onion ring guy. Montez, Waymond, no! Don't!- Take me instead!- Yeah, take him instead. I understand that Tina's what's best for T. A. C. and I'm ready. I'm ready to become... an Oriental. [ Intense electrical music ] [ Grunting ] No! Sorry. Strap him to the table. I can't be a cyborg, man. They don't even have any cool... they're just idiots. [ Stammers ] They just have metal in their brains. If you had, like, a laser dick, then, yeah, I'd be a cyborg. But there's nothing enticing me. Look, this is what we gotta do. We gotta go save Ders and get the hell outta this hell, all right? Yeah, where are we gonna go, Blake? I don't know. Let's freaking feivel it.- Let's go west.- To the ocean? Sh- yeah, right. I'm not an ocean dog, okay? I'm a city cat. [ Meows ] All right, fine. Let me think of another direction.- East.- Yes. Let's head east, to the heartland!- Yeah.- Vegas.- Vegas, I love it there!- Right?- There we go.- [ Laughs ] Now, let's ice our brains down, and formulate a well- thought- out plan.- [ Can sprays ]- Wait a minute.- What did you just say?- [ Mumbling ] Hmm? Yes, that's it. The freeze part, that's what I was thinking. The freeze part. Dude, you're a genius! [ Puffs ] I don't know. [ Over speaker ]... using your touch- tone phone. [ Can spraying ] Both: Yeah.- There we go.- [ Grunts ] Whoo! Oh! Oh!- Oh, sorry.- That's okay. Hey, Adam, what comes after\" l\"?- I don't... I...- Bow! [ Both laughing ]- Both: Oh.- Shiz- off!- Dude!- Oh, my God! I'm so excited about this. We could... okay.- We could die doing this.- Great, let's save Ders. We could die, this is exciting. I think we're good now. Ooh!- [ Softly ] Blake! Adam!- Shut up.- Shh, shh.- We're getting out of here. Take us with you! Take us with you, man!- Yeah, save us.- No, sorry, we can't. Yeah, but, um, we're always gonna remember you, and we'll never forget you, so... Take this yo- yo. It belonged to my father. Television set. Give it to your sons. Very cool. Cool yo- yo. Thank you, I'm gonna treasure this.- Don't go.- Yep. Guys, please don't leave us, okay? I cannot survive in here. All right, I- I love you, Jet Set. But he shit all over the walls.- And I can't... this smell...- You pooped on the walls?- I couldn't hold it no more.- I can smell it now.- [ Mechanical buzzing ]- I smell poo. I'm sorry, guys, we'll come back for you. We gotta go.- [ Grunting ]- Oh. It's okay. Relax, Holmvik. Once you've been oriented, all the fear, the emotions, they just disappear. Then why don't you try it? Because I run Telamericorp, and Tina answers to me. Prep the patient. What? What are you doing? What? No! Oh, no! You're changing the molecular structure of my flesh! Please don't! No, we're just shaving your body. Oh. [ Laughs nervously ] Okay. Been there, done that. [ Sing- song ] Spa day. [ Laughs nervously ] So, once we get to Vegas, thinking about doing a Cirque Du Soleil show based on the music of Nelly.- Wait a minute.- What? I mean, if Murphy Lee and the St. Lunatics want to be involved, that's fine. But it's really... it's Nelly's show. Tina's mainframe. That's where the lifeblood's generated. Destroying the mainframe would wipe out the mind control of everybody who's been oriented- tated. Very cool. We can't get in there, though, because we don't have Alice's collar key. So let's just focus on what I'm saying, okay? Let's go get Ders. Do you have air force ones?' Cause you're gonna need those. Um, I have G Unit sneakers. Once ingested, this probe will map your body, and we can begin the implant process, orienting you to Tina's mainframe. [ Groaning ] [ Stifled screaming ] [ Gurgles ] Yeah. Don't worry, you'll pass it soon. TMl. Position the optical excavation device. Time to scoop out them eyeballs, stretch. [ Coughing ] [ Sobbing ] No! [ Device beeps ] No! No, no, no! Watch eyes! Watch eyes! Waymond, please, please! I know you can hear me! Tell her to stop! [ Device buzzing ] Don't let her do this! [ Grunts savagely ] Good thing yo- yo strings are long as hell in the future.- [ Grunting ]- Whoop! Just what do you think you're doing? We're escaping to Vegas. Unless you want me to be your sex puppet. Put your hand up my ass, make me talk. Come on, let's get out of here! Let's go! Let's move! Let's move! Let's move! Oh, yeah, and, Alice... We quit. Both: Yeah. Yeah, we quit. Come on! Hup! After them now! [ Edgy electronic music ] Damn it. I am not running after them in these heels. Let's head back to the office. We'll activate the probe's tracking signal, and then we'll trigger the defense mech, in case they try to discharge. Damn it. What are they talking about? They fed me this probe thing. Oh, my God. [ Burbling ] I can feel it. Oh. Oh, God! It's too late to abort it, which is exactly what my mom used to say about me. I'm gonna have to murder you. I'm gonna have to murder him.- No, Adam, no...- Wait, wait... He's not Oriental ot Orient. Look at his eyes. You could tell he's Oriental by his eyes. But we do got to get that probe out of him. [ Stomach burbling ]- Oh.- Oh, God. Ooh. I think I know how to get it out. Huh? What? Both: How?- What are you...- What are you doing? Yeah. Tracker on. Get to the supply closet now! [ Beeps ] Defense mech armed.- [ Probe beeping ]- You hear that? I'm beeping.- Yeah, get it out, Ders.- Get it out.- Can you hear it?- Stop playing. I could kill him, I could still kill him.- Yeah, man, this is an option.- [ Groaning ] Oh, look. [ Both screaming ] Oh, my God, it's a tapeworm! I've had one of those. 17 feet long. Doctor told me I had to quit eating raw ground beef. Which I did. For a while. It's not a tapeworm! It's the thing! Obviously.- Yes, obviously.- Right, totally. Come over here, and help me get it out.- Keep pulling it out of your ass.- All right, you're okay.- I think you... you got this.- All right, uh... [ Laughs nervously ] All right, here we go.- Okay.- Oh, wait, no, no, no.- Not a pretty view.- Slow down, slow down. I think something's coming. Oh, yeah, no, that's it. That's the probe. I see something. Yep, yep. Oh, here we go!- [ Groaning ]- We got some lights. [ Squish ] All: Oh!- Oh!- Ooh! We got it! Destroy it, Adam!- Destroy it.- Yep. [ Grunting ] Okay.- You get it?- Yeah. No, I hear it. It's still beeping inside of me. We're not done, guys, it's still in there! [ Over headsets ] To the left, hurry! And bring them back alive. Barely.- Both: Yep.- It's still in there. It's still in there. Okay, okay. Round two, here we go.- [ Moaning ]- Yeah, no. You got it. [ Stammers ] Keep it up. Good work. Yep, I got it snagged. [ Screaming ] [ Skin ripping ] [ All screaming ]- Oh!- Boy! Yikes! Yes, you're gonna have a case of\" the hemmies\" after this one. Fissures and hemmies. You might never poop again, dude. Which would suck for me, I love pooping. It's, like, where I get most of my reading done. [ Over headsets ] Great. You've got them cornered. You know what? Kill'em. [ Laughs ] No, guys... guys, stop! Stop, okay? I'll just be a cyborg. Forget it, all right? Just stop pulling things out of my ass! Okay, I'll help. [ Both grunting savagely ]- Oh!- There it is! There it is! Oh! Oh! Break it! Hurry. Break it and destroy it!- Come on!- [ Screaming ] Okay, it's indestructible. Don't we have, like, a steamroller or, like, lava or... [ Door banging ] What do we do? [ Probe beeping ] Wait, what are you doing, you idiots? Finish them! [ Device beeping ] They're heading down the South hallway. [ Beeping faster ] They're heading towards my office! Wait, they're coming for me! Get here now! [ Probe beeping ] Damn it! It's Bill. We're not getting past him. He's so deadly. Look at him. Ow! Um, mirrors. If we can find several mirrors... Shh, Adam. Trying to come up- with an idea here.- Dude! Hey, have you guys seen Volume one or two? Volume now. [ Shrieking ] Aah! [ Grunting ] [ Screaming ] I got him! Bill! Both: No!- Oh, sheesh.- Ugh. All right. Bill! No! [ Overlapping shouting ] Adam, you can't kill them! Bill, he's still in there. He's just under mind control.- Yeah.- Oh, I thought he... I thought he was like an evil robot. No! Oh! You didn't know. He didn't know. Cyborgs are totally different than evil robots, okay?- Think of right?- Yeah, yeah. He would have those flashbacks to when he was a man. Oh, so he's actually... he's half- human.- Yes, he's still human.- I killed a human!- You killed a human, dude.- Oh, my gosh.- Oh, sorry, Bill.- Yeah. Okay, we hop over the fence. Hop on a plane, if they still exist, and be the kings of the Las Vegas strap. Attention, Jillian and Jet Set, prepare for orientation. Your time is now. Jet and Jill. You guys, we got to do something. I know what they're about to go through. Uh- uh, no. This is a trap. This is trickery! This is Tomfoolery! Let's go to Vegas! [ Helicopter blades whirring ] Vegas! No, don't you see? This isn't just about saving those guys. It's about taking back Telamericorp. Reclaiming the company that gave us nothing. It's a dirty job, but... Somebody's gotta Mike Rowe it. Hey, Blake? Huh? Fuck yo speech! Whoo!- You had to say that.- Vegas! No! Aah! Help! Adam, I got you! [ Both screaming shakily ] Oh, I gotta... I gotta get a gif of this!- [ Screaming ]- Ders... Get... Us... Off! [ Laughs ] Okay, all right. Ders, get me off! [ Both screaming shakily ]- Oh, my God!- You think that was funny?- I'm sorry.- You think that was...- let me see it!- I'm...- let me see it!- Sorry. Aah! Oh, this is funny.- Huh? [ Laughs ]- This is actually really funny.- It's pretty funny, right?- That was good.- Thank you.- Okay, all right. Let's go back and save the day! End tyranny! Find the switch for the fence! Oh, I got a boner for some reason. All right, now we find Alice, and we force her to free the people.- Yep.- Or... She forces me to fuck her or whatever, huh? No, Adam, we have to stop her, okay? This ends now. Come on, let's do this. Yes, that's a better plan than mine. Oh, damn. Jillian's a fembot.- Really?- Oh, they all are. Knuckle up, motherfuggers.- Mm, yeah.- Why do you have that?- Yeah.- Huh?'Cause.-'Cause why?- Why?- It was in my butt, dude.- That was in his anus. To study... Because the, um... Just go fight your one, already, please.- Yeah, go, you got him.- All right, wish me luck.- Good luck.- Whoo! [ Screams ] [ Grunts ] Whoa. Whoo! You are a bitch, cyborg Montez! You are a bitch! [ Screams ] Sorry, Jet Set!- Yeah!- Oh! [ Grunting ]- Oh, was that a roundhouse?- You know it. Whatever happened to roundhouses, dude? [ Screams ] I don't wanna do this, Jillian. [ Grunts ]- Oh!- Whoa.- Oh!- Blake, stop messing around! [ Tight voice ] I'm not messing around. She's crushing my testicles. Ow! Oh, oh. Let's see if I can crush her testicles. [ Grunts ] Oh! [ Choking ] Oh! Oh, ow. Swim dive! Yeah... oh! [ All grunting ] Guys! The xerox machine. Copy that. [ Grunts ] Attack! Now! Eww, oh! [ Grunts ] Come on, Demamp! Triple dude attack! [ Grunts ] [ Squish ] All: Oh! Oh, nice. Come on, let's go!- All right.- Oh. [ All panting, grunting ] [ Mouth full ] Oh, hi. Sorry, I was just... I was just eating. All you had to do was go through orientation. But no, you had to cause problems. Yeah,'cause\" cause problems\" is my middle name. Yeah! And being a cyborg? Well, that's overrated. And that's something I never thought I'd say. And we're here to put an end to the reign of Tina. Good luck with that, stretch. [ Beep ] [ Energy shimmering ]- All: Whoa!- Oh, my God! Tom Green! Wow, really big fan.- Really big fan.- I'm a huge fan. [ Metallic voice ] My bum is on the cheese.- My bum is on the cheese.- Cyber Tom Green, that's... that's awesome, but you need to shut it down.- Yeah.- Because soon enough, the cyborgs, they're gonna come for you. These machines would die for me, because they need me to survive. Oh, what, do you have a problem with that? [ Scoffs ] Kill them already. [ Energy humming ] All: Oh!- Swedish?- Something happened. The machines! They're taking over!- Now what are you doing?- The key card! We've gotta get to the mainframe! [ Grunts ] Screw it! Poor Alice, she's never gonna bang me. Daddy, would you like some sausage? Daddy, would you like some sausages? Sausages! Sausages! Get in and barricade the door! Barricade the door! [ All shouting, panting ]' sup, Tina? You naughty little computer. Oh, I'm gonna drain you. I'm gonna drain you good.- [ Screams ]- Come on!- Shut her down, Demamp!- There it is! We can't hold him much longer! I'm trying! It's much harder than it looks! All right, well... try a\" come hither\" motion. Oh, I'm\" hithering.\" Oh, I'm\" hithering,\" baby!\" Hither\" harder! Come on! You come for me! [ Energy hisses ] Both: Oh!- Oh, my God.- Okay. Please, not my face!- Uh, something's happening.- Something good? Something... Beautiful! [ Screams ] [ Epic music ] Oh! [ Screams ] Oh, come on! Oh, oh, oh. [ Panting ] Hey, uh, it's... it's way over.- Yeah?- Yeah, it's...- yeah, we did it?- Yeah.- You got him.- [ Laughs ] Oh, no! Oh, my God! We killed my hero. [ Screams ] [ All screaming ] Jeez! Where am I?- I don't remember anything.- Well, uh...- Well, you were a robot...- Yeah. And then now you're... you're just normal- ass Tom Green,- which is pretty cool.- Cyborg. Yeah, and actually... We are your childhood friends.- So...- Yep.- Like, your best friends.- Welcome back.- Yeah.- What's up, buddy?- Thanks, guys.- Yeah, we do what we have to.- Thanks, guys.- Hey! They're okay!- Uh- huh.- [ Laughs ] Oh, my God. We're heroes! Well, uh, I don't know about that.- We... we killed Bill, actually.- Yes. Very sorry about that. I did kill Bill.- Murdered.- That was my bad. I murdered him. I actually hope he's banging Alice's dead body in the afterlife. [ Laughter ]\" Bang dead Alice\"?- Oh, um... I meant...- You know what? Shut up, okay? Honestly, I think that was the dumbest story I have ever heard. I can't believe you let him tell it for so long. This is just a prototype for a pilot program. We're not gonna be implementing anything for, like, another year. All: Oh! Well, you should have said that right away. Yeah, we're gonna quit by then. We'll probably be dead by then.

His car was gone. Told you it would sink. Malcom, c'est Aria. Content de te rencontrer. je suis heureuse de te rencontrer aussi, Malcolm. Am I just crazy to think that this could work? Toby est\" a.\" Qui est\" E. Lamb\"? C'est comme\u00e7a que Toby se faisait appeller pour rentrer\u00e0 Radley. Alors, qu'est ce que cela veut dire? Toby est mort? Peut-\u00eatre qu'll veut seulement qu'on pense qu'll est mort. Either way, Spencer needs to know about this. O\u00f9 est Spencer? I was hoping she'd be here, but she isn't. Do you think Spencer just didn't get your S. O. S.? Maybe, but she must have gotten one of the other twelve messages we sent. Okay, you guys, she has ditched school before. All right? It's not a big deal. Yeah, you're right, I guess. Okay, we just need to get through today. If she doesn't call or show up, we'll go to her house after school. Girls, good, you're all together. I think you know Spencer's sister, Melissa... Have you seen Spencer? Have you talked to her? Not today. Is something wrong? Spencer didn't come home last night. She's not answering her phone. I was hoping she was here with you. Which is why I came here before I went to the police. Police? I understand Spencer's been a little\" distracted\" lately. Was there something on her mind that she shared with you? Anything about her plans? No, Mr. Hackett, um... She hasn't said anything to us. You're her friends. She must have said something. You can, uh, call the police from my office. Thank you. Let me know if you hear from Spencer. Yes, sir. Hello. Hello. I'm Eddie. I'm Jane Doe. Least that's what it says on my chart. Hmm. I've met some of your relatives. I come from a long line of does. Just gonna check the dressing on those bandages. Check away. What's a three- oh- two? I heard someone say that's what I am. It's a law that lets paramedics send you for a psych evaluation instead of throwing you in jail. Mm, lucky me. You are lucky. If the county psych ward hadn't been filled, you wouldn't have been diverted here to Radley. So, this is luxury? Compared to county, this is Vegas. What happens next? You get a doctor visit to evaluate your mental state. What's the matter with me? Just curious. Well... You're supposed to have amnesia. Hmm... Well, if I do, I certainly don't remember it. Try to get you some extra tapioca. Thanks. No trouble. Radley... Melissa must have the police looking for Spencer by now. I do not need more police in my life. Yeah, none of us do. Okay, the only thing that counts right now is finding her. Now, are you sure that Spencer didn't say anything about what she was going to do? Just that I should stop looking for Toby. What are we supposed to do, just sit in our rooms and do our homework? We look for her. We look where the police won't look, because we know her better than them. Like that bookstore that she likes. Or that crazy lab theater at Hollis. We look, we keep talking, and we check in with Melissa in case she hears anything. Mom, you're not gonna find anything in the paper. If Wilden took time off, he's not missing yet. I just wanna see if anyone's found anything. Like a body.\" Like\" a body? Or his car. Hey, well, if they had, there'd be somebody at the front door long before you'd read about it in the paper. Where is he? And what the hell does he want? It's Ted. Answer it. I can't. Ashley Marin's social secretary. Hi. Yeah, she's right here, she just has her hands in some bread dough. Are you still down for coffee later? Whispering no! No, no, no! Absolutely. Great, I'll tell her. Okay. Bye. Why did you do that? Because. Nothing is wrong, and... We have to act like we believe it. God, I want a pretzel. Just put some salt on it. You need some help? You know what I hate about arithmetic? You can't charm your way through it. Well, I'm sure that if anyone could, it'd be you. Coffee. Coffee solves everything. I thought that things were going okay with the new ghost- writing job. It was, and then... Things changed. Well, do you have a plan? I need something more than freelancing, that's for sure. I was actually thinking about teaching again. I liked it. I'm good at it. I'm just... Not sure. I know things haven't been fun for you. Hey... Look, you're the one who went from zero to daddy in sixty seconds. God, I miss you. Why? I'm right here. No, I know, but I... I still miss you. Spencer... Olli, olli, oxen free. Good morning, Ted. Ashley. Hey, Hanna. Ashley: Hi. I thought I'd come along. But I'll pay for my own coffee. Don't worry about that, I owe you both at least a cup of coffee. Why? For connecting me with Jamie Doyle. He's been great. The steeple's coming along. Oh, and we should get the bell back from the foundry tomorrow. That's wonderful. Well, let me grab my jacket and we'll go. Afternoon, padre. Detective Wilden. Ashley. Hanna. Detective... Looks like you're getting a lot of work done. Uh, yes... Sorry I missed the bell coming down. I had a couple of days off, went fishing. Catch anything? No. But that's the way fishing works. Sometimes you just have to be patient. Now it's back to work. Well, maybe you'll have better luck there. Maybe... I'll be just a minute. They called me to evaluate a\" Jane Doe\" the park rangers found wandering near a camp ground. Why didn't you tell them who you are? I lost my bag with my wallet and my phone. And then I knew what would happen if I did tell them. So I didn't. It's been very nice not being Spencer Hastings. Even if for only a couple of hours. What happened in the woods that made you not want to be Spencer? Toby Cavanaugh is dead. I saw his body in the forest. Somebody killed him. If this is true... it is true. I saw it. Why didn't you tell the park rangers? Because that wouldn't bring him back. If someone killed Toby... somebody did kill Toby, but I am the reason that he's dead. I'm gonna call your family, and then I'm going to call the police. Do you understand? Yes. Okay. I'll be right back. Stay here. Where have I got to go? Dad? Hey, can I talk to you? Sure. Dad, I need to talk to you about Ezra. And he doesn't know that I'm telling you this, and I really probably shouldn't... Aria. When I talked to your mom, she told me about Ezra. About the woman in Delaware. And the boy. She thought that I should know. Don't be angry at her for telling me. I'm not angry at her. Although I should be. How are you with all of this? Okay. Mm, not okay, just... Okay. Look, that's only one of the reasons that I needed to talk to you. Ezra is taking on these big responsibilities. And he's just trying to do the right thing. And it's hard, you know, he, he needs money. And he needs a job. A job. Teaching. It's, it's what he knows how to do, and he'd probably still be a teacher at Hollis if... Things had worked out a little different. Probably. So, is there something that you can do about this? I don't know. You don't know, or... you don't know if you're willing to do it? I talked to mom and dad. They're trying to get a flight, but the weather's bad. Everything is grounded from London to Spain. Wow. Spain too. They'll get here as fast as they can. Meanwhile, I will try to get you out. Don't bother. Don't bother? It's a 72- hour evaluation. It'll be over by the time they get here. Spencer, what happened? How far back do you want me to go? Right. I'm on a psych ward, and you're the one crying. I'm responsible for you. It's okay, Melissa. No, it's not okay, none of this is okay. Then it's not okay, it's all screwed up. Does that make you feel better? Stop it. I'm sorry. All this time, I just thought you were being cruel. I never thought that you might be... Unwell. That's a big relief for both of us. Melissa wanted me to know that Spencer was in Radley, so she came in on her way out there. Dr. Sullivan called her. What's Sullivan have to do with this? Sullivan found Spencer at Radley. That's where the rangers sent her. What? Where was she? Melissa said that Spencer was in the woods all night. Wait, she was just wandering around in the woods? Why? Was she looking for Toby? I don't know. You guys, we have to go there. We have to talk to her. Family visits only. It's some kind of mandatory evaluation. I don't like the idea of Melissa being the only one that's able to get in there. I know. That's why I left Dr. Sullivan a message. Guys... What am I taking? Shotgun antibiotics to knock out any infection. No tranquilizers, nothing like that? No, they need to do a mental evaluation. Can't do that if you're under the influence. Down the hatch.\" E. Lamb\"? That's me. Eddie lamb? Your last name is lamb? Yep. Somewhere in the past, I had an ancestor with a flock up some Mountain. My shift's over. Hang in there. At least you know you're not Jane Doe anymore. Night. Night. Why did they take her to Radley? We don't know. They found her at a campsite. And she's not allowed visitors because they're doing some sort of evaluation on her. I'm canceling New York. Wait, you're not gonna go to the seminar? Mom, you have to go. It's not a good time for this. It's exactly the right time. Hanna, it's not just a promotion. I told you, we'd have to relocate, move to New York. Get out of Rosewood. Right. Which means, get away from Wilden. It can't be that easy, just leaving. Well, I'm a big fan of the easy way. We can't just run away. Just go to the seminar. Please. And then we'll decide what to do later. I don't want you alone in this house while I'm gone. I'll just stay at Emily's. Mom, it's only for a few days. Dr. Sullivan. Oh, Emily. How are you? Okay... The way we left that last session... we heard about Spencer. She's all right. She's safe. When can we see her? Not while she's under observation. What happened to her? Did she say why she was out there all alone? Emily, Spencer said she saw a body in the woods. She thought it was Toby. Oh, God... The police and the rangers have been looking, but they haven't found anything. Do you think she was lying? I think Spencer was in an agitated state when they found her. I'm not certain what she saw. The police have been trying to contact Toby's family, to find out if he's all right. Do you know where he is? No, I don't. I thought the toughest thing we were gonna have to deal with senior year would be her prom dress. And that is still coming up. Meanwhile... Meanwhile... What are we supposed to do about Ezra and his situation? Uh, are we supposed to do anything? Aria wants us to. Hmm... Push comes to shove, and she goes to her parents. Yeah, and we're not... useless. Not yet. Mm. I'm the one who got him fired. I could... Talk to the Dean. Do you want to? Well, he is a good teacher. Other aspects of his character are debatable, but yes, he is a good teacher. Something else. What? If we helped him stabilize this new family, he might end things with Aria. I suppose that's true. But is it a reason to help? No... No... No, that's not right. I know what I saw, he's dead. Spencer, why don't you want to believe that he could be alive? Because I know what I saw! The body, did you see the face? No! No, but I know that it was Toby! Spencer, I think you took a lot into that forest with you. I wanna see my friends. Please, when can I see my friends? Not during the evaluation. After that... After that, what? After that, you'll either be released or further treatment will be recommended. I can call Emily, if you have a message for them. Just... Tell them that I miss them. I'll be back tonight. Thank you. Okay... You made it. Can't stay long. But, uh, you wanted to talk? I wanted you to meet someone. Hi. Emily fields, missy Franklin. Missy, Emily. So, shana was telling me that you swim? Hello. Yes. I swim. I met missy at the airport in Colorado. No way I wasn't introducing myself. She's headed for Philadelphia, I thought it'd be fun if you two met. Sit down. What do you want? I'll buy. Um, g- green tea. So, does Rosewood have a good program? Yeah, pretty good. The sharks, right? Right, sharks... Oh, God, um... congratulations. It's not too late to say congratulations, is it? No, it's never too late to say congratulations. Thank you. You ever lose one of those badges? Not if you want to keep your job. They have a chip, right? That's how they work with the doors and stuff? You're asking the kind of questions I'm supposed to report. I'm just curious. Seventy- two hours. That's not long. You can do that standing on your head. Then you're out. What if I really am crazy? You're not crazy. There was some trouble with the old badges. They had to change the whole system. What kind of trouble? What kind do you think? People getting out? People getting in? You want tapioca or vanilla tonight? Surprise me. I can't stop thinking about Spencer in that place. We'll get her out. Shouldn't we have seen it coming? Okay, I have to split myself between disasters. It's after three, so I'm thinking about my mom. Hey, if Wilden wants to come after you, he will. It's not like New York is in some other country. New York is on another planet. I don't know if she'll get the job, but... I want her to have the option in case things get worse. So, what did Wilden tell people about his car? Emily said he reported it stolen. Don't you think they'll find it? I mean, don't all cop cars have GPS? No, it doesn't work under water. It doesn't? Nothing works underwater, it's a scientific fact. You actually think you'll go to New York? If it's to keep my mom safe from Wilden, then... I'll make the sacrifice. Yeah, I... Hear it's awful primitive out there. Say cheese! Let me take one of you two. Great. I have to get going, but send me the video of your meet. I will. And I'm gonna try what you said about the cross- over turn. It works for me. Bye, shana. Bye, Emily bye. Bye. I didn't know you swim. Paige didn't tell you? No. Wonder why she never mentioned it. Don't forget to send me those pictures. You've got my e- mail. What makes you think this kid stole my I. D.? Because I saw it. I saw your I. D. with his picture. W- what would he need it for? To see somebody in here. Somebody that he couldn't just visit because... He was doing things for her. Out in the world. She? Yeah, the patient's name was Mona Vanderwaal. Do you remember her? She's hard to forget. And the boy. His real name was Toby. You haven't touched your pudding. Saving it for later. Delayed gratification. Shows discipline. Patience. I'm not so patient. Wasn't just the badges. They had a problem with the visitors' passes. They traced it back to someone on the staff. Who? Who was it? I like my job. I've been here since I got out of the Navy. One of the ways that you keep your job is by keeping your mouth shut. Eddie. It seems like we're a little bit past that point. Maybe. Maybe not. She was here. Mona Vanderwaal. This was her room. Will the circle be unbroken\u266aBy and by, by and by\u266a\u266aThere's a better home awaiting in the sky, in the sky\u266a? Will the circle be unbroken\u266aBy and by, by and by\u266a\u266aThere's a better home awaiting\u266a? ln the sky, in the sky okay, what do you suppose loser Mona was doing in there? Praying for bigger boobs? Why do you even bother going to church? I like to cover my bets. What is that? You were writing in it all during service. It's my diary. Since when do you keep a diary? Since forever. Let me see. Okay. No, you're gonna have to wait till after. Till after what? After I'm dead. Ew, don't be so gruesome! I'm not being gruesome, I'm being mysterious. Forget it. I don't want to read your stupid diary, anyway. Yes, you do. I'm writing them for you.\" Them\"? They're beyond scandalous. You're gonna need them if you're gonna carry on after I'm gone. Carry on with what? Fresh muffins at the bakery. Come on! Here you go. Thank you. Please, have a seat. I didn't send her to ask for any favors. No, I know that. I- I didn't swear her to secrecy about what's going on, but I never told her to ask for help. I don't want you or Ella to think that I would do that. W- we know that you didn't. And I'm sorry she put you in that position. Oh, don't be angry at Aria. She wanted to help. Oh, no, I- I'm not angry with her, I couldn't be. There are just things about this situation that I haven't been able to explain to her. Well. Pride is a tricky thing. Why did you come here today? I talked to the Dean. I wanted to see if there was room in the department for you. And, uh, I'm afraid that there isn't. But I still want to help you, if I can. Because? Could just be habit. I have reached a point in my life where I spend a great deal of time trying to make some kind of amends to someone for... Something. There's no shortage of bad judgment in this world. Tell me about your son. You got all kinds of secret talents. I don't play so much anymore. My sister and I used to play four- handed pieces. But that was a long time ago. Toby's not a name you hear everyday. No, it's not. I've known one Toby in my life. Nice kid. I met him when his mother was a patient here. My Toby's name was Cavanaugh. What about yours? Be a hell of a coincidence if it was the same Toby, wouldn't it? Yes, it would. Do you believe in coincidences? Not as much as I used to. Excuse me... Hi there. What's the number on file for the... Keep practicing. Woman at desk: Just a minute, and I'll get it for you. We could just say that we're Spencer's cousins. Hanna, nobody's ever gonna believe that. We have to find out why she's so sure Toby's dead. Well, they have to let her out after 72 hours. No, they don't have to let her go at all if she's really... You know... What are you saying? I'm saying,\" A's\" been turning the screws so long, one of us was bound to snap a string. Just never thought that it would be Spencer. I did. Why? Because there's a downside to being too smart. You were never the weak link, Emily. Spencer was. So, where's the fourth musketeer? Haven't seen her today. If you mean Spencer, I think you know exactly where she is, she's in Radley, and you're the reason why. Radley? Don't play dumb, Mona. Could've gotten through senior year and been finished, but you wouldn't leave it alone. Listen to me... no, you listen. If Spencer doesn't get better, and she doesn't get out of Radley, you're gonna wish you broke your neck when you fell off that cliff. Woman on P. A.: Attention... Aria Montgomery, report to the principal's office. Aria Montgomery, to the office. This is completely informal conversation. I want to make sure that we avoid any... Misunderstandings or miscommunications. Okay... Ezra Fitz has applied to the school district as a substitute teacher. If his application is approved, he will probably, at some point, be assigned to cover a class here. It's come to my attention that... Since Mr. Fitz left Rosewood high, you have seen him. Occasionally. In a social context. Yes... The school has no interest in the... Personal lives of pupils. But under the... unusual circumstances, I feel that I have to ask. Are you currently seeing Ezra Fitz? Seeing him socially? No, I'm not. I- I saw him... After he left Rosewood high. Socially. A few times. Um, I suppose it might have looked like something that it wasn't. Which it wasn't. There was never any question of it... Being anything serious. I'm glad you both realized that before things... Went too far. Yeah. It's definitely a good thing. Otherwise, it might have been a little... Awkward? Yes. Very awkward. I'm sorry if this was embarrassing, but, uh... I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask. No, I'm glad that I could clear things up for you. And you have. Good. Small world, isn't it? Well, they call it training, but it's more of an assessment. To see if you can do the job. I'm sorry to cancel so late, but... The bank only does this twice a year. Nah, that's okay. It's, it's important. Yeah. And I'll only be gone a couple of days... This time. This time? Yeah, if it works out, I will be... taking Hanna to New York with me. So the promotion wouldn't be here. No, it's in New York. Well... When would you go, if they offer it to you? I'd have to make the decision pretty quickly. Miss the great unveiling... We can come back for that. Well... I should wish you luck. But I don't think I can right now. Wouldn't feel honest. I like seeing you. Right here. I like seeing you. If there was some other reason. For you leaving, besides the promotion... Would you tell me about it? This is the only reason.\" If.\" Would you tell me? Because maybe I could do something about it. I'd like to try. If you'd want me to. There's nothing you have to worry about. Are you sure you don't want a cookie? No. Thank you. Okay. I brought them for Sybil. She was my favorite nurse. Very kind. It's important to reward kindness. I bet you were surprised to see me. You're taking a big risk. Coming here. Talking to me. Just visiting a friend. Why did you kill Toby? What did that get you? That's an interesting question. If it were true, if I killed him, why would I want to talk to you? Look at all that's happened since you turned me down on our little drive up the Mountain. All the pain and disappointment and loss, because you were stubborn. But I believe in second chances. I'm a generous person. No, you're not. You wouldn't be here if you didn't need something. Whatever it is, Mona, the answer's no. Ali was never pregnant. She thought she was, and she panicked, but it was a false alarm. No way you can be sure of that. Ali told me. I have her diaries. Remember? I don't have all of them, but... I have most of them. And I know where the rest of them are. I have the answers, Spencer. I have the answers to questions you haven't even thought of. Leave me alone. You have all these bits and pieces. You're trying to put together a jig- saw puzzle, but you've never seen the picture on the front of the box. You need me. Otherwise, you'll never really know anything for sure. Go away! Before I start choking you again. Mona, I've got nothing left to lose. They already think that I'm crazy. You're not crazy. You're as sane as I am. Your mom should have the contact info. I will call you as soon I get to the hotel. Okay. Don't worry, mom. I'll be fine, we'll be okay, Mrs. marin. I love you. I love you. Geez, did you pack enough for three days? If I forgot something, I can always go back. Ignore him. Hanna, you don't have to talk to him. You know what, Emily? Sometimes you poke the bear, and other times, the bear pokes you. It's from a movie. Hello. Hello. Are you following me? Me and my mom? Why would I do that? I don't know. I'm just wondering if you are. No, I'm not following you. Well, then go away. I went away. Right. You went fishing. That's right. And now I'm back. And while I was away, I did some thinking. You, me, and your mother. It's complicated. I don't think any of us have been completely honest with each other about things. Honesty is tough. Yeah, but you could make that easier on everybody, Hanna. And how could I do that? The car, Hanna. The car? Just give me the keys, and tell me where you left it. That's all you have to do. And then there's no more trouble from me. All I want from you and your mother is that car. I knew who I was when they found me. And I knew that my family and friends would be worried. But I just... I wanted to fold up and stop. I didn't, I didn't wanna think anymore. You were overwhelmed. Yeah, well, I wasn't Spencer Hastings for almost a whole day, and... Nobody else showed up to take the job, so... Guess I'm stuck with it. Because you're the only person in the world that can be you. You don't have to rub it in. I'm sorry, this can't be very entertaining. I mean, there are people here with real problems. Just like you. Yeah, just like me. I, uh... I fell down in the woods. When I was running. I fell down, and I looked at the ground, and I... Saw my hand, and my sleeve, and... The little button on my sleeve. And some dirt, and an old acorn, and I said to myself:\" Okay, if this is the last thing that you ever see,\" I can handle that. I'm done.\" I've had enough.\" But it wasn't the last thing that I saw. I just kept going. How do you keep going when the worst thing has happened? What do you have to change inside to survive? Who do you have to become? I'm sorry, I don't expect you guys to understand. You don't know me. I'm sorry, but that's true. You don't know who I am anymore.

{"title": "Ailiseu Episode #2.3", "content": "The representatives from the South have arrived. The Korean Peninsula Unification Preparatory Committee... What do you think it would be like? The government of North and South Korea will sit down... and discuss an unofficial plan in case unification suddenly happens one day. Would you mind if I shared my thoughts on that? Go ahead. The hawks will use the failure of the doves as their opportunity to counterattack. If you miss this chance, you'll end up giving them more power. Then you think I'm one of the doves? Not exactly. However, one thing you can be certain of is that I'm not on the hawks' side. You are confident as always. I believe there are two types of people in this world. Ones that are confident because they truly have nothing to hide. And the others who are confident because they have nothing else to lose. Which one do you think you are? Is it okay to just relax out here like this? Because of tomorrow's schedule, we've been diligently working nonstop for several days. Let's at least cut loose for a few hours. I feel like I'm going to suffocate. It's okay, right, Team Leader? Okay, you guys should relax a little. But we're going to relax until five o'clock... and then we should go back. Since we are only here as support for the security team... why don't you take it easy? Now that the three of us are hanging out like this... it reminds me of the day we first got drunk together. Hey, why are you bringing that up now? Ji Soo Yun... why don't you stop now? No way! Today... we're going to drink until there is only one person left. When I go outside all dressed up... ten people will pass me. When I look back... I see 15 people looking at me. I'm that kind of woman. Oh, yeah... is that right? I've never met anyone who boasts about holding their liquor and actually can. I have to go now because something came up at home. Will you be okay? I'll wait for her to wake up and take her home. If you have to carry her, be careful. She might terrorize your backside. I'll be going now. But I have no memory of this at all. Yes, I'm sure you don't remember anything. How can you not remember that? Hey, you try this. This is traditional Hungarian bread. Until Sz\u00e9chenyi bridge was built... there was hardly any contact between the Buda and the Pest area. Buda and Pest? So they named it Budapest after combining those two areas? Yes. The Buda area which mainly consisted of the upper class... was able to join with the working class of the Pest area because of the bridge... thereby resulting in the combined name. Ji Soo Yun, you are so knowledgeable. Okay, you two knowledgeable people here have a good time exploring Buda and Pest. This humble ignorant agent will get going now. Then should we walk for a bit? Okay. Ah... it's really nice. I wonder what they're talking about? It's probably similar. They're probably talking about what they should have for dinner tonight and such. You're so unromantic. Team Leader. Are you forced to go out with me even though you don't like me? Who forces themselves to go out with some they don't like? Then... are you going out with me because you like me? Why do you go out with me? Why do I go out with you? What are you talking about? It's because I'm curious and a bit frustrated. A man should express how he feels about his woman so she knows his heart. If you keep this up, what are you going to do once I run off? When that happens don't regret harping on and on about whether you can or can't live without me. You should be good to me while I'm around. I'll be good to you.- Really?- Yes, I'll be good to you. Okay, then, your hand... You're such a good boy.- Soo Yun.- Huh? It's Team Leader Yoo. Go ahead and answer. I'll look around here for a bit. Pretty. How much are these? They are 9, 700 forint.($36) They're so expensive. Do you like them? Me? Want dolls like a child? They are kind of pretty though. We'll see you later. Don't mess around. Be ready for tomorrow. Yes, sir. What're you doing? You know the one who killed Section Chief Park? I thought I saw him so I followed him... but I lost him. Are you sure about it? Let's just hope that I was mistaken. Why aren't you in bed? I couldn't sleep. What about you? I couldn't sleep either. Nothing will happen tomorrow, right? Why? Are you worried? What Baek San said bothers me. Probably nothing will happen... but you never know, so you should be careful. You too. Everyone in position. Thanks for coming such a long way.- Nice to meet you.- Thank you. I'm Kwan Young Chan. Please have a seat. About the economic issue in the North and the tension between the North and the South... There seems to be a heavy emphasis on the North's nuclear program. We did launch the Unha- 3 missile. But you also launched the Naro rocket. we should focus on economic issues. Then we'll carefully consider this issue. Anyway, I'm very pleased to see so much willingness. Thank you. The president has made things easy for us. Okay, that's it. Cut it off. Was there anything special? Other than wanting a guarantee for economic support... the North seemed pretty satisfied. The summit meeting... Reunion of separated family members... Reopening the Geumgang Mountain and the Kaesong industrial region... Money is always the real issue, without exception. Other than those... Kwan Young Chan doesn't seem to be against the free market economy at all. He must have a lot of enemies. Wonder that's true. Changes will get targeted and criticized by the mainstream. The North shouldn't be any different than the South in that respect. Then can we relax until the dinner banquet? We haven't even stepped outside the hotel since we got here. Do you call this living? Try to endure it little longer. Tomorrow, the official schedule will be over. I'll show you around the city then. Thank you, big sister. What? You've never seen me dressed up? Excuse me? Did you think people in our profession go to parties in suits also? In the spirit of providing services, when going to a party, we go with the flow. What do you think? Is it okay? You look great. Are you here to brief me? Yes, this is the content of conversation the North representatives had during the break. You've read it already, right? Summarize the important details and tell me. They'd like to expand their economic partnership with the South. Like Kaesong, Rajin and Hwanggumpyung... they were discussing a long- term collaboration to develop another industrial region. They'll provide more of a protective shield than a few nuclear arms. And... they mentioned something about nuclear testing. I think they'll bring that up during the second scheduled talk tomorrow. What do you think? Do you think we can trust the peace treaty they offer? As you know, field agents do not make political judgment. However, if I were to share my opinion as a citizen of South Korea... rather than securing a promise for ceasing the nuclear testing... I believe we should pursue their promise for nuclear disarmament. I do not believe nuclear arms can ever serve to protect the people of a country. Nuclear arms may not be able to protect people... but don't you think it's effective in maintaining a political system? On Christmas day in 1991... the government of the country that possessed the most nuclear arms in the world collapsed. It was the Soviet Union. If its economic and diplomatic power was weak... it would amply prove that the nuclear armament... can neither protect its people nor maintain its political system. I guess so. This is just my own opinion. Then should we head over to the banquet hall? Yes. Yes. Tell the waitress who just entered the room to come out and see me. Yes.- Check her out.- Yes. Here she is. Can you speak English? I'm sorry. I'm going to ask you several things.( Hungarian) How long have you been working here? I've been working here in the hotel's catering department for two years now. And I'm a Chinese national. I can't capture the audio. Yes, we are recording it now but I don't think we can capture the conversation. You have that thing you're good at. I'll give it a try. Are you living with your family here? My family is in Beijing. Beijing... Where in Beijing? Mei! What are you doing there? Get to work now. I'm sorry. What's going on? Right now, Park Chul Young is talking to a waitress in the kitchen. Don't you think it's a false alarm? Baek San said the target could be either the North or the South. We have to check everything we find suspicious without exception. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Oral method? What's that? What? Figuring out people's speech through lip reading. Can you use the oral method on this? I can do it in English but they are talking in Hungarian. Wait a minute.- Byung Jin.- Huh?- Copy this part and transmit it to the B3.- Okay.- It's been sent.- Okay. Thank you. I never imagined I'd use an antique like this telex machine in my lifetime. I think this is older than me. With that, we can avoid the North guys listening in on us. Representative Kwon Young Chan didn't directly mention it during the talk. But I think he believes that the North should follow China's economic model. I understand there are quite a lot of supporters of that policy in China. As long as the promise for the economic support comes through, it's going to be a done deal. Also it appears it'll be possible to put together a Unification Preparatory Committee.- I'll report that to the presidential house.- Yes, please. I believe you are already aware of the situation inside North Korea. The power struggle between the military hard- liners and the moderates has become so serious that they didn't hesitate to incite violence in the middle of Pyongyang. Kwon Young Chan is a typical moderate in the North. In my opinion, he's risking his life for this talk. I thought the moderates had already taken over all the key positions thus ousting the military hard- liners? The analysis has told us, because of what happened... the dissatisfaction of the military lines has reached its maximum. Due to the balloon effect, no one can anticipate when, where or what's going to happen. I recommend you take extra precaution. So the NSS would like to add additional agents for your protection. Don't you think you're putting too much security on someone who isn't even in the office anymore? The tasks of the security personnel and that of NSS agents are little different. You'll find further details in the report I'll submit after we return home. Okay, I'll think about it little more. Since you asked me, I helped you out. But do you think it's necessary to protect a former president to this extent? Once the Unification Preparatory Committee has been formed... he'll be the first chairman of that committee. There is a high chance that he'll become a target for the opposition. Then I'll see you tomorrow. Would you like to have a glass of wine with me? I have a very nice bottle of French wine. No thank you. I still have a lot to do for tomorrow. The finger prints of the waitress in question have been taken from a serving glass. We sent them to headquarters. We should hear back from them soon. I couldn't decipher what Park Chul Young and Mei talked about because they were talking in Hungarian. But I was able to decipher the conversation Park Chul Young had with his subordinate afterward. She said she's been working in the hotel's catering department for two years now. I think her family lives in Beijing. Park Chul Young didn't seem like he believed her claims. I got it. I've brought his dry- cleaning. Can I look through them? What's going on? She brought your shirt. Send her in. What about the fingerprint verification? Have you heard from them? Yes, but they couldn't come up with a verification.- What the woman's name?- It's Mei. M- E- I. Look her up from the hotel's employee files. Yes. Hi, Mei. I've cleaned your shirt and brought it back. I'm really sorry about earlier.( Chinese) This room has a beautiful view. The sunrise is even more beautiful from this room. If you want, I can show it to you.- Is that really okay?- Of course. I looked into it and she's just gone to the representative's room drop off his cleaned shirt. She went to the representative's room? Yes. Wrap up everything here and re- examine tomorrow's security plans. Got it. She came up. It's a different person. He's in there right? Yes, but he's with a female hotel employee. I know. Step aside. Can I go in for a minute? This is my first revenge against the People's Republic. We meet again. Who are you? Are you part of IRlS? Maybe... Have you located where the gun shot came from? It came from the northern corridor on the 5th floor. The priority is the safety of our VlP. You two, follow me. Team Leader Jung, determine the situation with the North and report back to me. Korean entourages are not allowed to enter. Are you okay? Get her... Get her alive no matter what. The windows... Cover them all so the room can't be seen from the outside. I'm on my way to the roof. Get in. The area AP should be blocked from the right side. Yes, I got it. He's closed in too quickly. I'm going down route B. Arrived at AB5. I'm going to turn to the CH7. There are two assassins. One of them is identified as a woman. Have you discovered their nationality or anything else? Not yet. But I believe there is a good possibility that IRlS is responsible for this. Of course, we can't exclude the possibility of the North Korean military hard- liner's involvement. The presidential plane can take off in two hours. I think you'd better get ready. Why now? Connect me to the KH907. I'll give you the coordinates. KH907... I'm connecting now.- Check it now.- Got it. Hold on a minute. We ran into the firewall put up by the Hungarian authorities. Okay. Five seconds. It's D5. Put your hands up and on your head. Do not move. If you do, we'll shoot. Put your hands up. This is a warning. Put your hands up. This is the last warning. Hurry up! You must be insane. How can you just jump over like that? Whatever. You finish up things from here on. Listen carefully. The bomb that's in the car is different than the German ones and it's TNT 40612 model... What's this? Did you have to be in such a rush? I was talking to you. You should've at least let me finish talking then pushed the button. And just now, if I had arrived several seconds late you'd have hit the edge of the boat and died! Learn some manners. They'll have to change into a car. The only place where they can quietly dock their boat is Cespel Island. Hyun Woo, come to the Cespel Island dock. I'm going to tell you once again. My work is done here now. Don't ever come to see me again. And as I said before, deposit the money in Duonyakgom's account. You know Duonyakgom who follows me around... Do not deposit the money in my account because there is seizure order on my account. Sure, if we come out alive... What? Even if you have to die, you should die after you deposit my money, okay? Don't forget Duonyakgom. You drive. They disappeared from our surveillance. I think they're completely familiar with the roads. A vehicle thought to contain the runaways was located that the Cespel Island dock. Okay. Why don't you stop frowning for a minute? You had that expensive work done on your face. Why would you spend your days frowning like that? Joong Won. I'm tense as it is now. Can we just drive quietly in peace? So I'm telling you to smile. Haven't you heard of the saying that if you smile, you'd become lucky? But anyway, the more I look at you, the more I like your original face better. Even though you looked unsophisticated, you appeared to be solid and skilled in fighting. Tell me honestly. You are regretting it now, aren't you? Tell me. Tell me. Hold on tight. Soo Yun. Be careful. Hyun Woo, we are in the anti- op building. When you arrive, position yourself in area C. I'm going to chase them from area A and B. Also request for backup from the Hungarian authorities. The woman is moving from area A to area B. Okay. You must belong to the North Korean military. Me? It's been a while since I left the North. Don't move. Are you okay? There were two but we lost the male suspect. We'll take her. You must find out who's behind this. If not, you are going to be suspected as the mastermind. I don't know what proof you have to say that but... I have a plenty of proof. There was a man who had the North Korean accent. He is a former North Korean soldier... and I believe he received special military training. And you... what did you talk about with this woman at the hotel banquet? Did you give her an assassination order? You bastard! What do you think you are doing? Put the gun down. Put the gun down. I give my word. I'll definitely find out who is behind this assassination. Wait a minute. I have something to say to you. Tell me. There is no use taking me. You won't hear a word out of my mouth. And... Who's behind in this? I tried to kill her but I failed. What should I do next? Report back. We must begin our next mission. Okay, I got it. Listen. I'm not sure whether it'll target the North, the South or both... but something big is going to happen in Hungary. Representative Jo Myung Ho is in danger. What? What are you... They are targeting us both. Check the runway condition one more time. Yes, I'm doing it now. What the hell! The firewall again?- Break it through!- It's been completely blocked. I think the NBH has discovered us.- You can't break through?- No, no... I can do it but... I think it's going to take some time. We lost the satellite transmission. I think we've been discovered by the national security office here. Turn left here. Deputy Director, we'll try to patch things up here but any more use of the satellite transmission will be difficult. Okay. Okay. The status of the presidential plane? They've finished inspection but it'll take a little time to fuel it.- Prepare for immediate take- off.- Yes. Are you alright?- Let's escape.- Let's go. Let's go. Are you okay? Withdraw! Representative! While we're at it, we should put NSS's function under the National Intelligence Services. What to do when we keep ourselves low is strengthen our legs to jump even further. With the authority as the deputy director, I'm giving you this solo assignment. Bring him. You can't let anyone else have him. The one who took me out of the special prison. The one who attacked the safety house and killed Section Chief Park... Be careful of him. IRlS might be behind that woman but... they're bound to look for a sacrificial lamb that's close to them. I only work for the justice which I think is right. We'll be allies. I already have the most powerful weapon I can ever possess.

{"title": "Ancient Aliens The Einstein Factor", "content": "He is considered the most brilliant mind of the 20th century. His brain was wired in a different way than normal human beings. With radical theories that redefined the forces of nature. We thought we had a pretty good understanding of how the universe worked. Einstein showed that we were just wrong. But was Albert Einstein's genius somehow otherworldly? Any time that there is an individual with extraordinary gifts, is it possible that they're a little bit more than human? And could that genius unlock the secrets of the universe? It's Einstein's theory which allows for the real possibility of time travel. Millions of people around the world believe we have been visited in the past by extraterrestrial beings. What if it were true? Did ancient aliens really help to shape our history? And if so, might evidence of alien contact help to unlock the mystery behind the genius of Albert Einstein? Sourced By: Deafdude sync and corrections by bellows www. addic7ed. com Principe Island, 140 miles off the west coast of Africa, May 29th, 1919 During a rare total solar eclipse, astrophysicist Arthur Eddington photographs the deflection of star light around the darkened sun, to try and prove Albert Einstein's much disputed Theory of General Relativity. The theory of General Relativity says light will bend in a gravitational field. So when the eclipse blocks out the sun, the stars close to the sun can now be seen. And if the light bends, they'll be in a slightly different position. Einstein was exactly right. The light bent just as much as he predicted it would bend. Newspapers around the world had headlines saying, Einstein's theory was vindicated, and in fact, space and time were a lot stranger than we had imagined. In his lifetime, Albert Einstein was a worldwide celebrity whose name personified the word\" genius.\" His groundbreaking discoveries redefined Isaac Newton's laws of physics and created a completely new understanding of how the universe works. Before Einstein, physicists viewed space and time as simple, unchanging, static ideas that objects existed in and that events took place in. According to Einstein, the existence of matter and energy in space can change its shape, it can warp time, it can distort it. And his theory of relativity totally upended everything we thought about these most fundamental of physical concepts. Before his Theory of Relativity, our understanding of space was equivalent to a time when we believed the Earth was flat, essentially. Einstein's Theory of Relativity expanded our understanding of the universe on that level. Albert Einstein was a genius. And his genius was looking at this stuff and just thinking about it from a completely different angle. And that's what really allowed him to make huge progress in areas that other people hadn't been able to make up to that point. But what was the origin of Einstein's revolutionary scientific breakthroughs? Was it a product of his innate gifts? Or might it have come... from somewhere else? Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879 in Ulm, Germany. As a child, he displayed an unusual interest in the less tangible forces of the world. His father, when he was ill one time, showed him a compass. And Einstein, as a child, was so amazed. Here there was this invisible force that caused the compass needle to point, and that sparked his imagination. What is that? How does that happen? So, this is sort of the beginning of things that made him realize that what we saw in the world had sort of a mysterious connection. This curiosity led young Einstein to a physics degree from the Swiss National Polytechnic in Zurich. But following his graduation, the aspiring physicist struggled to find work. He wasn't able to get immediately a job that he wanted, which is teaching physics. So he took a job that was through a friend of his at a patent office. The patent office helped him sharpen his mind by examining these patents. And eventually, it also gave him the time that he needed to think about these things that puzzled him. It was during this time that something remarkable happened to Albert Einstein... something which suggests that Einstein was communicating with a realm outside our galaxy, a realm that some ancient astronaut theorists believe may be designed by extraterrestrials. Albert Einstein was very adept in putting himself into altered states of consciousness through what he called his thought experiments, which were a kind of three- dimensional metaphorical reverie. It was the kind of thing of putting himself into a place that most of us won't go, and exploring that space... so that he could receive very, very novel and new ideas. Thought experiments enable you to visually or geometrically approach a problem that maybe mathematically might be difficult. For example, Einstein liked to think about what it would be like, from a first- person perspective, sitting on a beam of light moving through space. What would he see from that perspective? He had all sorts of different visual ways of thinking about physics. In 1905, after immersing himself in these thought experiments, Einstein authored four papers that would redefine mankind's perception of the universe in multiple ways. Included in that year was a paper which essentially proved that atoms were real entities that really existed. That was a very controversial idea at the time. In that year, he published a paper on what's called the photoelectric effect. Everybody believed that light was a wave. Einstein said, no. Light really acts like a particle, and it comes in little discreet packets. These particles of light eventually led Einstein to the notion of the stimulated emissions, so we have lasers. We use lasers for everything from eye surgery to cutting metal. One of his papers included the equation E=mc2. It said, you could create mass, you could destroy mass, and it gave us an idea of how mass might come into existence in the first place. Einstein showed that mass can be converted into useful kinetic energy. And so, this is the basis of the energy we get out of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. And another paper he published that year became the beginning of his Theory of Relativity. This was an amazing array of things to do for a scientist in an entire career. The fact that Einstein did it all in one year is virtually miraculous. To get a sense of how dramatic those papers were, imagine if someone came up to you and said, everything that you know about space and time and matter and energy is wrong. And then, they would give you all the math and all the explanation of why everything that you know is totally wrong. It's often referred to as the Annus Mirabilis papers, which basically means, the miracle year or wonderful year. What was the source behind Einstein's incredible insight about the laws of physics? Is it possible, as ancient astronaut theorists contend, that Einstein's ability to enter altered states of consciousness connected him to an extraterrestrial world? One that allowed him to access information about the inner workings of the universe? Einstein said that when he first developed the concept of relativity, it was like a storm going off in his head. And this would show that he had a different kind of a brain and his brain was wired in a different way than normal human beings. Albert Einstein was known to spend hours on end sitting in a chair, formulating an idea or a thought to its inception. Now, was he tapping into some type of advanced field of knowledge? It's very possible Einstein used this type of technology to a certain level. When we look at history and when we look at the people themselves who are the giants on whose shoulders we stand, what they are saying is that this information wasn't theirs but that something beyond them, something which was larger, something which was divine allowed them to receive this information and give it to the world. All the knowledge of the universe exists in the cosmos. And maybe Einstein was able to access that knowledge, that he was more in tune with this what I would even refer to as a metaphysical world. That he had this direct access. He didn't know how he did this, but his being knew it, his essence. That through his being, he was able to unlock the secret of the universe. Did Albert Einstein's use of thought experiments grant him access to an extraterrestrial realm, as some ancient astronaut theorists believe? Perhaps the answer lies not in other worlds, but locked away within the pieces of Albert Einstein's brain. Princeton, New Jersey. April 18, 1955. World- renowned physicist Albert Einstein dies from a ruptured aneurysm in his heart. Hours later, Princeton Hospital pathologist Thomas Harvey carefully removes the famed scientist's brain. When Albert Einstein died, there was an autopsy performed on him in 1955 at Princeton University. And the man who performed the autopsy removed Einstein's brain. And he actually took Einstein's brain out of his head and he put it in a cookie jar filled with formaldehyde, and he held onto it. So there was an urban legend that went around that said that somebody had Einstein's brain, which was actually true. What everyone didn't realize is that the key thing that defined Einstein, which was his brain, was being driven around in the backseat of a car of this physician. It was a very weird story. His motivation was not just simply the ghoulish thing of having this, you know, great trophy, but it was to try to see if he could understand it. And he began to give slices of it to neurobiologists and neurophysiologists to see if they could understand what it was about Einstein that was different. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Present day. 45 miles south from the hospital where Albert Einstein's brain was removed, and hidden away behind the walls of this museum resides what's left of arguably the greatest mind in human history. Here at the Mutter Museum, we have mummified human remains, skeletons of mutated bodies. But our most important artifact is right here: Einstein's brain. We have a wide range of artifacts, but they are all in the medical spectrum. Einstein's brain, it's an amazing representation of not only a medical specimen, but one that represents one of the greatest minds in the world. In 2011, the Mutter Museum received 46 slides of Einstein's brain from Dr. Lucy Rorke- Adams, who acquired them from an employee of Thomas Harvey. I've been extraordinarily fortunate to have been the caretaker of these slides for over 40 years. And I regard them as a scientific treasure. The best way to describe his brain was that it looked like the brain of a young person. At age 76, he has beautiful preservation of the neurons and no degenerative disease of any kind. How is it possible that at the advanced age of 76, Albert Einstein possessed the neurons of a healthy young man? Why was his brain unique to that of other humans? Even more curious is the fact that Einstein's parietal lobe... the part of the brain believed to be involved in the manipulation of objects and the processing of numbers... was 15% wider than the average human. These are actual images taken in 1955 of Albert Einstein's brain. One thing to point out here is you can see the red line is relatively expanded compared to normal brains, marking the expansion of the parietal lobe. The parietal lobe of Albert Einstein is truly anomalous. It's unique. It's intriguing to think that this might have something to do with his unique ability to put himself into these very abstract scenarios. He was known for thinking, what would it be like if I was traveling at the speed of light? That's a hard place to put your mind in. The parietal lobe might be involved in these types of abstract thoughts. So the fact that we see kind of an anomalous anatomy in the parietal lobe of Einstein, it's intriguing. In the 1980s at UC Berkeley, Dr. Marian Diamond discovered another amazing feature about Einstein's brain structure. Diamond found that it contained over 70% more glial cells than the average human brain. The brain is not just the communication between neurons, but the communication between neurons and glia. Glia are crucial for the very basic carrying of information. We could hypothesize that a brain with a larger number of glia per neuron could have advantageous effects on brain performance... enhanced cognitive abilities. Probably 99. 9% of the brains across mankind are identical. But certain brains stand out. And in the case of Einstein, this was a genius who seems to have had some kind of hardware that was different. What could be the reason for the extraordinary genetic makeup of Albert Einstein's gray matter? Is it possible, as ancient astronaut theorists believe, that his advanced brain allowed him to receive and decipher messages from an otherworldly realm upon entering a trance- like state? Could this explain how he was able to envision his four groundbreaking papers that transformed man's understanding of the universe in under a year's time? How could one person in one year create and write such important papers? And his own colleagues had no idea what he was talking about. The way Einstein thought was completely different than people before him. How do we account for Einstein's large brain capabilities? Is it something in human evolution that's just causing him to evolve faster? Or was he potentially given some type of leg up genetically? Maybe some type of extraterrestrial gene that we still haven't yet identified. Are there individuals out there that may have DNA sequences that we're not familiar with, that are unknown, that are non- terrestrial, that have never been discovered before? Anytime that there is an individual with extraordinary gifts, is it possible that they're a little bit more than human? Could Einstein's extraordinary brain anatomy explain his remarkable genius? Or could it be that his use of thought experiments and his unique brain structure allowed him to receive and decipher information from an otherworldly source? Perhaps answers can be found by examining the incredible minds behind other geniuses throughout human history. Stockholm, Sweden, 1921. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards Albert Einstein with the Nobel Prize in Science for his groundbreaking contributions to theoretical physics. What separated Einstein from his contemporaries? How did the 42- year- old physicist achieve such a seemingly perfect blueprint of the universe. We see that across time and space we have pockets of people who have received tremendous amounts of information which really have propelled civilization along. Obviously, the question, then, is do they have special brains, or is this just something which happens by concentrating on the right thing to access this information. Is it possible that Albert Einstein's practice of thought experiments allowed his genetically advanced brain to receive messages from a metaphysical realm, as ancient astronaut theorists believe? If so, could there be evidence of other geniuses across human history whose greatest achievements materialized through altered states of consciousness? Athens, Greece. Outside the Hellenic Military Academy sits a statue of a war hero... and the founding father of Western philosophy... Socrates. Socrates' contemporaries described the philosopher as being strange in many ways, including spending hours each day consumed by his own thoughts. One of the most stunning examples of Socrates' daydreaming actually happens while on campaign as a soldier at the siege of Potidaea. Socrates was caught in the grip of a thought or an idea, and he remained fixed and thinking silently for an hour, for another hour, for another hour. He displayed an extraordinary endurance that his peers may have found odd and suspicious and puzzling. We often think that a genius is eccentric, but I think some of their eccentricity comes from the fact that they really are in touch with other realities. In the case of Socrates, he said that he was able to access a demon. Now, a demon for Socrates is not some evil creature. But the ancient Greeks had this subcategory of gods who really were talking to human beings, explaining the mysteries of life to us, explaining why we were here. Is Socrates' so- called demon evidence that the founder of Western philosophy was mentally unstable? Or could Socrates' demon be proof that he was in contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence that was sending him messages from a distant realm in the cosmos. I think it's too easy just to say that, yeah, Socrates was nuts or that he was schizophrenic or that he was hearing voices. The demon is some kind of messenger, some kind of bridge between him and the realm of the metaphysical that he is trying to attain. Did Socrates' practice of deep meditation connect him to an extraterrestrial intelligence, as some ancient astronaut theorists contend? If so, could there be other geniuses with similar claims that they received information from a higher realm while in a trance- like state? In the case of Leonardo da Vinci, in his writings he describes laying down on a bed in his room and taking a candle and placing the candle at the foot of the bed. And he would lie down on the bed and look at the flickering of the flame on the ceiling, and it would put him into a very, very deep state in which he would be able to imagine and come up with new ideas. Puccini said that his great opera Madame Butterfly was from God... that he wrote it down, but it came directly from a divine source. William Blake, whose entire opus, his writing and painting, was based on repeated angelic visitations. Brahms said that his music came from something beyond himself. We don't know if they're, in fact, receiving communication from some divine or powerful source beyond their own skin, or if they may be in touch with their own unconscious or deeper wisdom that they're not customarily hearing from. In the 1900s, Serbian- born inventor Nikola Tesla pioneered modern electrical engineering and was the driving force behind today's wireless technology. In his writings, Tesla describes his method of approaching a complex engineering problem. Nikola Tesla was someone who wrote extensively about using very, very powerful visualizations. In fact, he said that he was able to visualize a motor and then actually run research and development, R& D, on the motor in his mind, so that he could tell where there might be, for example, mistakes or flaws. And he would be able to do almost all of that in his mind. in this altered states of consciousness. Nikola Tesla, he's a person who believes in the existence of extraterrestrial beings. He is a person who really believes that he can communicate with other galaxies. Perhaps the greatest piece of evidence that Tesla believed he was in communication with otherworldly beings can be found in a letter he sent to the American Red Cross in December of 1900. In the letter, he writes,\" We have a message from another world, unknown and remote. It reads: One... two... three.\" Tesla was a genius with certain eccentricities. Everything he did was in threes. And it is interesting, I think, because this is a level of symbolism. When we realize that so many of our ancestors, whenever they are talking about communication with the divine, and how the divine downloaded this information to them, we see this rich layer of symbolism there as well. Why was Tesla so obsessed with the number three? Could this be a clue that Tesla was using his own internal form of wireless communication to connect with cosmic advisors, as ancient astronaut theorists believe? And could this also explain the remarkable genius of India's Srinivasa Ramanujan? Although Ramanujan was an unexceptional student, he is widely considered the greatest mathematician in history. And according to his journals, Ramanujan believed he was being guided subconsciously by an otherworldly being, the Hindu god Namagiri. Namagiri was the family deity of Ramanujan. And basically, everything the family did was linked with this deity. Much of his creative work was actually done by going to bed with an intention to be visited by a Hindu deity that he worshiped. And when he would fall asleep, he would become lucid in the dream time. And he would receive enormous amounts of information. In one particular dream, he talks about seeing a very large red wall and a hand that came out and wrote equation after equation after equation after equation. He memorized the equations, and when he woke up, he actually then went to work verifying the proofs. The vast majority of all of his equations were new and important and utterly groundbreaking. All of the science that we need to eventually be able to create portals, star gate travel, teleportation... it all needs a mathematical foundation. And the closest that we have right now is the Ramanujan equations that we've been able to decipher so far. It is an irrefutable fact that mathematics is the language of the universe. So if Ramanujan's formulae do, in fact, check out, who knows what the potential is of those conclusions? It could be life- altering. It could revolutionary. Is it only a coincidence that many of the greatest minds in human history claim to have received information from an otherworldly source? Or could it be possible that Socrates, Nikola Tesla, Srinivasa Ramanujan, as well as other geniuses in human history, were using altered states of consciousness to access an alien realm, a realm that some ancient astronaut theorists believe contains the entire knowledge of the universe? If so, where might this realm of knowledge exist? Perhaps answers can be found in Asia, within the pages of an ancient Hindu text. Angkor, Cambodia. Here in the northwestern jungle stands the largest Hindu temple in the world... Angkor Wat. Built in the 12th Century, the temple's design is meant to represent Mount Meru, a mythical mountain that exists in the cosmos that the Hindu believed was the center of the metaphysical universe. Numerous stone carvings adorn the walls of the temple, depicting scenes from the Hindu epic the Mahabharata. Within the pages of this ancient text of Hindu mythology, there is a description of a non- physical plane of existence in the universe called the Akashic Record. Akasha is actually a Sanskrit word. And the Akashic Record is a term that basically, the idea behind it is that all of the information in the universe is preexisting, and an individual can actually tap into that information. Our ancestors began to look more into this, and the Akashic Records came about. Basically, the notion is this. That somehow all the information, not just from mankind, but everywhere in the universe, is somehow accessible. Some cultures actually say that this information really is a gift of the gods, that they left this somehow behind for us to use at our own will. And we are able to download this information from this other realm, this hall of records, whatever you want to call it. An interesting thing to correlate with the Akashic Record might be from Star Wars, the Force. Some type of cosmic energy that's omnipresent, and we have the ability to tap into this. This is something very new in our own sciences... trying to discover and understand this field of knowledge. Is it possible that Albert Einstein's method of meditation, which he called his Thought Experiments, was actually connecting him to the Akashic Record? Could the Akashic Record be the source of inspiration behind the world's geniuses? If so, how could such a metaphysical plane of knowledge exist? Perhaps the answer can be found in one of Albert Einstein's many theories. In 1935, Albert Einstein published a paper describing quantum entanglement. It theorized that if a particle is split into two parts, both remain linked to one another, even when separated over vast distances. Experiments showed that two particles separated I space and time demonstrated a connectivity. If you changed the spin of one particle, the other particle would actually change its spin, as well. In other words, if something happens to one, the other responds in the same or an equal and opposite manner. And this occurs instantaneously. So it's a form of instantaneous communication. It's what Einstein referred to as spooky communication at a distance. What we have to remind ourselves is that we are made of stardust. Our whole body consists of material that has been here since before the beginning of time. And these particles that we consist of... each and every particle contain the knowledge of the universe. It's not only real, but it can explain to us so much weirdness in this world, which we still don't understand and call paranormal. And this would include the idea of telepathy and remote viewing. Remote viewing is the practice of using deep concentration to visualize locations or objects beyond sight and sound. Starting in the 1970s, the United States initiated a program called Project Star Gate to train individuals to access a higher realm of knowledge. Using controlled scientific settings, remote viewers attempted to sense unknown targets and then record their impressions on paper. The U. S. government have funded remote viewing programs, as did the Soviets, as have various other governments around the world. Remote viewing exercises have taken place for people to try and observe that which is on the moon, on Mars. And these are proper scientific programs, with accuracy. The U. S. Military remote viewing program has scientific protocols for how to do this. There are really specific techniques where an individual can put out a question or a query, and if they are in that altered state of consciousness, they will receive information. If you read the biographies of famous geniuses and things like that, each one of them has their own description for how to do this. Why would the government spend millions of dollars on all these advanced studies in areas like remote viewing unless there is some type of valid need to experiment with these types of technology? If we think about the fact that we're all pretty much made of the same elements in the universe, is there maybe some atomic level of energy that allows us to communicate and tap into knowledge that we're now starting to rediscover? Is it possible that remote viewers were attempting to replicate the meditative techniques behind Albert Einstein's thought experiments? Can this explain how remote viewers might possess the capability to transcend both sight and sound? Could Einstein's thought experiments be the inspiration behind the incredible breakthroughs of Socrates, Nikola Tesla, and other geniuses throughout history? All these different geniuses, Ramanujan, Tesla, Socrates, according to their own diaries, always said that they were in communication with some type of otherworldly entities. So, were all these people just crazy, or is it possible that the universe is far more complex than we think? Is it possible that mankind's greatest minds had the ability to access a realm of knowledge left behind by otherworldly beings? Could this be evidence that the Akashic Record actually exists, just as the ancient Hindu believed? And if a select few have the power to tap into this alien realm, does this mean that the extraterrestrials who created it can influence them as well? Albert Einstein's incredible legacy, which includes over 300 scientific papers, continues to influence the world over a half century since his death. And while Einstein redefined our understanding of the universe, perhaps his greatest contribution to mankind is still to come: time travel. It's Einstein's special theory of relativity, speed of light, and the general theory of relativity which allows for the real possibility of time travel. Some scientists today believe that Einstein's theory of relativity creates the possibility to travel through a portal or wormhole called an Einstein- Rosen bridge... a space anomaly that may actually be a gateway to parallel universes. In the theory of general relativity, space actually acts like something that you can bend and warp and make holes in. An Einstein- Rosen bridge is a particular example of a wormhole, and a wormhole is a structure in space and time that involves kind of tearing a hole in space, stretching the material... if you think of space being a material... and reconnecting it somewhere else. An Einstein- Rosen bridge takes two points in space and connects them so that if you travel in one end, you come out the other, even though those two points appear in different universes. It's essentially a teleporter, something that allows you to get between two distant places instantaneously. Could Einstein's theoretical wormhole actually serve as a portal to another universe, perhaps opening a gateway that will one day establish contact between humans and extraterrestrials? When we take a look at the idea that there are wormholes and that these are actually generally accepted by some of the most brilliant individuals on the planet, what you begin to see is that all of these pieces are in place to suggest that there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe and that there is also the likelihood or possibility that we have had contact in the past or have ongoing contact now or may have contact in the future as well. Was Albert Einstein's monumental work actually a lifelong quest to establish contact with extraterrestrials? Did otherworldly beings provide him with information about how to transcend both space and time? If so, why? We find that the greatest discoveries across time and space don't come to hard work or intensive labor, but that really the genius somehow is able to access a realm and that that realm is able to pretty much download that information to them and makes them remember forever onwards as geniuses. In history you have certain people whose genius is just so incredible, it's like they're able to see the future, and they're not going to just influence the world then and in the future, but what they're going to do is going to dramatically change the world forever. We tend to think of civilization as this slow ebb of information, that somehow across the flow of time we have progressed, but really this is not the case. We have made giant strides forward because, at pockets in time, there were certain geniuses living. Are extraterrestrials accelerating the cognitive abilities of a select few to help further the development of human civilization, as some ancient astronaut theorists believe? Could this explain Albert Einstein's extraordinary neural anatomy? Is it only a coincidence that arguably the greatest mind in the history of the world had a higher concentration of glial cells and a wider parietal lobe than the average human brain and was as healthy as the brain of a young man when he died? That is extraordinary evidence. If we were able to study the brains of some of these other geniuses... Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, and perhaps now of someone like Stephen Hawking... I think we would find that their brains, too, are significantly different than a normal human's. There seems to be something within our DNA whereby we go in one direction and we seem to have a normal human being, but also certain things within our DNA are able to make us a genius, and definitely Einstein was one of them, but what makes this switch work is something which we have been completely incapable of answering. Were the greatest minds in human history receiving information from otherworldly beings? Are geniuses the link between us and them? Could Albert Einstein's thought experiments be the key to unlock the genius that exists in each and every one of us? If so, who will be the next Einstein? Where will he or she come from? And what new dimensions will they reveal to mankind? sync and corrections by bellows www. addic7ed.

You know, squirrel, I got to say that I'm a little stumped, you know, at the fact that you're taking the city's side. Especially after all the shit they did to you. I'm not taking the city's side, okay? Well, you know what? Not taking a side is taking a side. You are a bottomless pit of lame clich\u00e9s. What, you fist- bumping him on that? You know what?

Because somebody at the table doesn't have any... real money. Har har har. Should I call? Well, look, you got to work it through. Now, your Uncle just raised, so maybe he has a good hand, maybe he doesn't. What's important is he's got a big- ass stack, and he's leveraging it against your stack and he's also in position, and that's what you want to be in any good negotiation. Remember that. It's how the rich get richer. Always at the expense of the little guy. Right, Marty? Remember that, too. So should I call or not? It's up to you. Totally up to you. Oh! He said he ain't scared. Ooh. He ain't gonna get bullied. Okay. I like that. I like that, lil' man. Okay, all right. All right. Game on. What about you, big squirrel? You interested in contributing some of your big stack to the cause? Oh, you want some pretzels? You can have all the pretzels. No, no, I'm talking about the real money. Oh, oh, the real money. No, no, no, no, no. Yes. Ah... I'm in. Like I thought. Pop. No, dad, there's no way yeah, I'm in. I'm taking money from you. I'm going all in. I'm not gonna let Uncle Malcolm out- leverage...

I think that says more about my relationship with my mother than the quality of the tickets, but go ahead. So I call Marty to offer him up the other ticket, but he never gets back to me. He doesn't call me back, he doesn't text me. I have no idea what the fuck is... what? I always thought that smug arrogance was your most off- putting quality. I had no idea it was tween girl insecurity. Fuck off. There's the Clyde I'm comfortable with. I don't come across as insecure, do I? Yeah, hey, Marty, it's me. Again. Uh, Doug.

All right, bye. God. Hey, has Marty seemed a little distracted to you guys lately? Even fucking Doug agrees with me. Yeah. Even Doug agrees with you. God, I know. It's weird.

Has Marty finished his projections of practice growth and sources quarterly report yet? See me? It was due yesterday. Those deadlines have always been, um, more like suggestions. Well, now they're a deadline. Understood. I will let him know. Great. So, um... where is Marty, anyway? He is meeting with a prospective client. Oh. Well... that's very exciting. Mm- hmm. Huh. You know, Jeannie, I have, um, been giving an awful lot of thought to the future of this company. To the, um, kind of people that I would like to see leading us. People like you. Are you about to give me another promotion that changes nothing? Fair enough. Yeah. Actually, I was thinking that it was time for you to run your own pod. Official offer is going to be on your desk by end of day. So what do you say, Jeannie? Are you ready to step up? Hey! Marty. Hey. Hey. It's\" phoh.\" Do you like\" phoh\"?

See you. Yep, real pleasure. How'd it go with steam bath Willie? He showed me his business, we made a deal. Wow. Hope those two weren't mutually exclusive. Does that give, uh, us enough money to make the move? No. I mean, not if we... Not if we want to do it right. You got to make a list, okay? Your people. People that we can poach, but, you know, people that can also keep their mouths shut. Okay. Um, yeah, I'll start to reach out. No, no. Don't- don't reach out. No, just- just make a list. Okay. Uh, julianne is looking for your ppgs's. Oh, fuck. I- I don't have time to deal with that bullshit paperwork. Jeannie, please, can you just do it for me? Okay. Thank you. Something else? Yes, actually. Julianne has offered me my own pod. I thought you were coming with me. I am. So, what, then? What does... what does... What does it matter? I don't know. It's just a nice vote of confidence. I'm just... it's... It's nice to feel that your hard work is appreciated. I'm just sharing. Uh- huh. You hedging? Jea... look, Jeannie, if you... If... if you think that you're better off... I'm not hedging. Staying here, then... Okay. I swear to God, if this fucking asshole Doug calls me one more time, Jeannie... Oh, I got to answer for Doug now? He and Clyde have been asking a lot of questions, Marty. You have to... Just make the... Just make the list, please, and take care of whatever bullshit it is that julianne needs. I got to go look at some office spaces, okay? Okay. Um, I- I'll run by and talk to the idiot before I go. Oh, shit. Hey, there you are. Hey, Marty, uh, guess who. Yeah, it's me again. So I don't know where you are, but, uh, call me when... He's here. He is here. Who? Marty is here? Mm- hmm, yes. Oh, I guess you're here. That's great. Okay, well, you know what? I'm gonna swing by. I got to talk to you about something. I'll see you soon. Bye. Doug. Yeah. What is the big emergency? Oh, uh, a friend of mine from hbs put me in touch with the ceo of tracer, this heat- seeking software company in the bay area. Okay. He's looking for a possible expansion consult. He wants to sit down with me, so I got to get the big guy up to speed. Okay, hold on, he wants to sit down with you. Yeah. So why do you need Marty? Well, it's a potentially huge client for us, and, uh, you know, Marty's a closer. You know, it's a no- brainer. Well, Doug, when are you going to stop letting other people take the credit for all of your hard work? What? Is that what you think? Pretty simple question. Yeah... no, but it's not like that. No, we're a team, you know. Okay, mm- hmm. We work together. It's easy. Okay, so if Marty signs this guy, is it a win for the team or is it really a win for Marty? These are your contacts, you did all the prep work, so go out there and take what's yours. Doug, why don't you quit blowing up my phone? What is it? Um... Uh... nothing. No, I... Nothing? Really? It was something... But never mind. I googled it, and I was able to... I'm out.- You look amazing.- Thank you. You know the last time that we saw each other? Uh, oh, my God, it was the night after graduation when we did all that ecstacy. Remember that? Fucking seriously? Not really. Oh, yeah, it's probably for the best. Probably.

That's surprising because, back in\" b\" school, I'm pretty sure you guys hated each other. We did not. We were just competitive. Oh, and you were the girl that just partied all night, slept through microeconomics and still aced those exams. I kind of fucking hated you. Guilty. Well, I'm still taking you to lunch. Okay.

Come on, this bullshit, th- th- the casual lunch, the waxing nostalgic about the good old days. Come on. You're right... I do. I have an ulterior motive for inviting Tamara to lunch today.

Uncle Malcolm... he took me to his rally today. What they're doing to those people in public housing is fucked- up. Roscoe, I'm not going to tell you again about your language. It... it is. Knock it off. Can't you donate something to the cause? Grandpa did, and he has a lot less money than you. Really? Can I talk to your Uncle alone for a second, please? Okay. You know, dad, you're either a part of the solution... Or I'm a part of the problem, I know... You're a part of the problem. What? What? He wanted to come down. What was I supposed to tell him? You... you're supposed to tell him no, Malcolm, because you're the adult and he's a kid. I told you I don't want him involved in this shit. You can't keep his eyes closed forever. And what happened to not taking pops' money? Roscoe showed him the video, and he insisted. I wasn't gonna embarrass him in front of your son. What are you doing? What's the number? What? Just tell me the number, okay, Malcolm? Oh, wow. You know, don't go pretending like you don't lean on dad. He's practically raising Roscoe by himself.$5, 000? Know what? Fuck you, Marty. Okay. Uh... okay. I'm sorry. That was an insult of an offer.$10, 000. How about, I don't want your money? Right,'cause you're a... A not- for- profit entity. Is that it? So, this is where you leverage me out, huh? Just open up your checkbook... Malcolm... And write it, it's just that simple. Malcolm, just... Look at me, man. Okay, our whole thing is supposed to be about how different we are, right? We're... we're the same. That is bullshit, and you know it. Okay, it's not. Look, we're just... We're just working different sides of the cash cow. I know you, because you're me. We're both just trying to do our thing, right? So I'm gonna write this check. Maybe it's here tomorrow, maybe it's not. But either way, bro, it's- it's... it's okay. Really. So I told him,\" make it about the kids.\" Sweet guy, Matt Damon. He's my friend. You know, we should all hang out before... Jeannie beannie, what are you doing here? Finishing up a project. Who is your friend? Oh, my God, I can't believe you noticed her. I'm so embarrassed. This is Samantha. She's a business major over at ucla, and her biggest turn- on is corporate America. Can you believe it? So, which office is yours? That huge one. You see that huge one over there?

Are you sucking a dick or throwing up? Throwing up. Throwing up. Okay. Ppgs's? Doesn't Marty usually deal with those? Yep. The fuck is this? Hold up, are they giving you your own pod? Yeah. I think I'm gonna take it. Of course you're gonna take it. Why the fuck wouldn't you take it? This is huge, Jeannie. Congratulations. Thanks. Yeah. Your office is locked. Yeah, we're gonna head out. So let's go. Why does it say\" Marty kaan\" on your door? It's my nickname, okay? Let's just go. Morning, pop. Morning. Malcolm show up yet? No, not yet. Not yet, huh? Well, I wouldn't get my hopes up. What's that supposed to mean? I gave him a charitable donation last night. I over- donated. You paid him to leave? No. I gave him a choice, and he chose. Can't believe it. The fuck is wrong with you? Wait, wait... Pop, doesn't this just prove that his whole desire to reconnect with his family was just a bunch of bullshit? What it proves is what a manipulative person you can be. Wait a minute. He conned you out of I don't know how much money. He didn't con me out of any money. Okay. Whatever. I- I'm the manipulative one? Pop, you're a grown man. You can do whatever you want with your money. Hmm. But he's trying to use Roscoe, okay? I'm- I'm just supposed to be cool with that? Well, no,'cause that's your domain. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? What it means is you've been trying to get your brother to leave here since the minute he came, so you used me and your son to justify this shitty, Congratulations, Martin. Pop. Pop. Hey, uh... Clyde, you- you never asked me how my, uh, meeting went yesterday. Yeah, it's'cause I don't give a fuck. How'd your meeting go yesterday, Doug? Went as smooth as butter on a baby's ass. Why would you put butter on a baby's ass? It's a figure of speech. Jeannie, can you do me a favor and put a bullet in my head? In a minute. Finally got your ppgs's. Here is a list of people that I think you can poach, and... Yeah, you know what, you- you call them. Now you want me to call them? Yeah, they're your contacts. But they've always been my contacts. What's changed, exactly? Jeannie, what do you want me to say? I don't want you to say anything... Oh. Look at this, here are my all- stars. Hey. You know, a little bird told me that you gave this one her own pod. I did. What, don't you think she deserves it? Well, honestly, I think Marty, you know, at the end of the day, I have got to decide what's best for the future of this company. No, absolutely, but our pod kind of keeps the company afloat, and I can't do that without her. I mean... Jeannie's not somebody I can just replace. So, I understand you having to make the hard decisions, but in the future, mm- hmm. Yes. It would be great if you just gave old Marty a heads- up. Okay, well, you know what I think? I think, Marty, that you and I should continue this discussion later. I... In private. Yeah. Okay. I look forward to that. Me, too. Good to see you. Yeah. Great. That was a jump ball. What, you think I'm afraid of julianne hofschraeger? She scares the shit out of me. Yeah, me, too. Hmm. So, you ready for this shit storm that's coming? Bring on the shit. What are you doing? I don't know. Isn't that how you do it? All right. Get on those calls, okay? I actually have a dinner tonight with Nate... That I can cancel. I'm- I'm happy to cancel. Oh. Uh, no, that's cool. I can cancel it. I really... hey. Nate. Hey, Nate. Have you met Marty? Hey. The dildo king, at your service. What? Yeah. That is what you guys call me, yes? Yeah. No, nobody says that. I... I'm pretty sure it's what you guys call me. I told him. I've been called a lot worse. It's okay. Uh, you ready to go? You need more time? Um, I think I need... Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. I'll just be down there. Okay. Hey. Nice meeting you, dk. There it is. We're on a good road, right? Like, this will work itself out? Oh, yeah. We're... just blue skies from here on out. Okay. Okay.

You're giving it to me? It's mine now? You weren't very good at this when you were my age, were you? Ha ha ha ha ha. All right, smart guy. Yeah, time to get dinner started. What is Probably an electrical storm. Put the fire out. Get in the tent! Dad! Owen? We'll be all right, kid. Whoa. What kind of storm was It's a big one. The highway should be just over that ridge, and then we'll get a ride to the nearest town. Dad? That's what you get for camping in the Boonies, I guess.- Dad.- What? Look. This is impossible. We drove through here yesterday. There was nothing here. It's like... someone dropped a town right on top of us. You need some help. You two look lost. Who are you? What is this place? Name's Graham. I'm the sheriff. Welcome to Storybrooke. Once Upon A Time 2x17- Welcome to Storybrooke Original air date March 17, 2013 Sync and corrections by atrn97g for www. addic7ed. com I did it. I won. That should hold you. I cannot believe you put me on the early shift. Not my fault you stayed out all night. When I put over easy on the menu, I was talking about the eggs! Morning, madame mayor. Good morning, Crick... Dr. Hopper. Beautiful day, isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. As we build our birdhouses, remember, what you're making is a home, not a cage. A bird is free and will do what it will. This is for them, not us. They're loyal creatures. Ohh. If you love them, and they love you, they will always find you. We'll pick this up after recess. No running. Miss mills. What are you doing here? Refresh my memory. How long have you been a teacher here? Um... I... I'm not sure. As long as I can remember. Come with me. Why are we in the hospital? Tell me. Do you know this man? No. Why? Who is he? He's a John Doe, a coma patient. No one's claimed him. Maybe someday he'll wake up. Maybe someone who loves him will find him. That would be nice for him. But I wouldn't count on it. Good morning, mayor. That uniform suits you nicely, sheriff. So... well- fitted. Want me to come over later? Hey! You like apple pancakes, too? Who are you? Whose child is this? Is he yours? Mine? No. I was never so lucky. He's mine. And you'll have to excuse him. His manners are a little rough around the edges. I'm, uh, Kurt Flynn. Sorry to interrupt your breakfast, but we're, uh, looking to rent a hotel room for the night. Why would you need a hotel room? The same reason that most people need one. We need a place to sleep. Would you excuse me for a moment? Graham. I got a room for you. Who the hell are those people? Uh, I don't know. They just showed up. They were camping in the woods near the toll bridge. I was just as surprised to see them as you are. I don't like surprises, sheriff. I find them threatening. And do you know what happens when I feel threatened? Bad things. Black always was your color. I'm here to bury my mother. So if you've come to gloat... I came... to pay my respects. We had our differences, but Cora will always have a place in my heart. You killed her to save your own life. Sadly, desperate times call for desperate measures. Like getting Mary Margaret to trick me into killing my own mother? You may be able to hide behind your dagger, but she can't. She's going to die for what she did. Oh, come on. We both know killing her will cost you the thing you want most... Henry. Why don't you just give up this obsession with vengeance? You know it can never make you happy. Yes, it will. You had a whole curse worth of vengeance, and what did it get you? A gaping hole in your heart. That was your curse. Which you cast. Still haven't learned your lesson, have you? What lesson? The same one your mother learned a long time ago. You can't have everything. She wanted power, ripped out her own heart to get it. You want vengeance? Henry's the price you'll pay. Time to cut your losses. Never. I will have my son, and I will have my vengeance. I will find a way to have everything. Anything? She won't eat a bite. What's wrong with her? Nothing. She's just a little... sick. You guys are lying to me, aren't you? No one's lying. are, just like you did about my dad. Henry, I... He's right. No more lying. Emma... He deserves to know. Here's the thing, Henry. Cora's death... Mary Margaret was partially responsible... for it, and that's why she's so upset. No. No, no, she couldn't. She was trying to protect us. But she's snow white. She wouldn't hurt anybody.- Get out.- I think you're gonna wanna hear what I have to say...- for her sake.- What are you talking about? Regina. She's planning to strike back- against your mother.- What is she gonna do to her? Oh, she didn't say. No. You don't get to come in here and just drop a bomb like that. You're gonna figure this out. And you're gonna help us. And why should I? Because aside from us being family now, Mary Margaret saved your life. Now you owe her a debt. And you always pay your debts, don't you? You're gonna help us stop Regina. Thank you. It was really good. Ahem. You're in my seat. Sorry, miss... Mills. Mills. Mayor Mills. I always sit in that seat. But I'm already sitting here. I, uh, I just spoke with our mechanic. He assured me that your car will be repaired by the end of the week. Really? He told me it would take at least two weeks just to get the parts. Well, things tend to get done quickly when the mayor asks for them. And I'd hate to keep you from getting home to... New Jersey. Home of the boss. Hmm. Anyway, thank you, your mayorness. Mayor. Whatever. We really appreciate it. Let's go. What's this? It's a gift for letting me sit in your seat. For me? Maybe this time, you won't fall. This is the last time I'm working the early shift. Good morning, madame mayor. Beautiful day, isn't it? Oh! Oh, madame mayor, I'm so sorry. You should be. Watch where you're going next time. Mm- hmm. Beautiful day. Save it. Oh! Mayor Mills, I am so sorry. I ran into you. Why are apologizing? No, I should have been looking where I was going. You're not even going to fight back? Fight back? Why would I do that? I'm not happy. I believe Dr. Hopper's office is down the street. Oh, I don't wanna talk to him. I wanna talk to Very well, madame mayor. What is it you wanna talk about? This town. This isn't the deal we made. I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. You don't, do you? I was supposed to be happy here. Forgive me, but, um... You're the mayor. You're the most powerful woman in the town. What is there to be unhappy about? Everyone in this town does exactly what I want them to. And that's a problem? Well, they do it because they have to, not because they to. It's not real. I'm sorry. What exactly is it you want? Nothing you can give me. Hello, Kurt? Mayor Mills. Good. You're still here. I would love to see Owen before you leave. Would you two like to come over for dinner tonight? Great. Where... is it? Aah! Thank you, mommy. Well, it appears we just missed our dear Queen. What is this? These are Cora's belongings. Looks like Regina's planning to use one of her spells on Mary Margaret. Something's missing. Chimera blood. And viper's eye. What kind of curse do you need those for? It's the curse of the empty- hearted. What the hell does do? In theory, it has the power to make someone love you. Doesn't that break magic laws? You can't bring someone back to life. You can't force someone to love you. Yeah, but this particular spell can make someone that they love you. And if you're as desperate for love as Regina appears to be, you might just believe it. She's gonna use it on me, isn't she? Hey, buddy, why don't you go back upstairs?- Let us handle this.- No! Emma, you said you were gonna be honest with me. Now why is Regina using this curse? Because it's the only way she can get everything she wants, that she can get you. But if all she wants is me... your mother is a complicated woman. She wants your love, of course, but she also wants vengeance on Mary Margaret. How does the curse give her both? Because the last ingredient she needs to ignite the curse is the heart of the person she hates the most. You have to stop her. No, I don't have to do anything. On the contrary. I believe warning you fulfills my debt. Not even close. This is my wife's life we're talking about. Not to mention your grandson's. Yeah, well, wars have costs. Nice. Well, this is a blood feud, dearie... one that goes back a very, very long time. And the only way you could end a blood feud is by the spilling of more blood. That is the only way I know to eliminate your Regina problem. By what, killing her? Is there no other option? I'm afraid not. Stop! Listen to yourselves. You're talking about killing my mom. You used to be heroes. What happened to you? Henry. No matter how this plays out, we need to keep him as far away from it as possible. She's right. Cora was dangerous because she didn't have a heart. Regina's even more dangerous because she does. This is, uh, really delicious lasagna, isn't it, Owen? Not really. Owen. It's okay. I know I'm not the greatest cook... unless it involves apples. Speaking of which, how would you like to help me make turnovers for dessert? There's a bunch of apples sitting out in the sink. Why don't you go pick out some good ones? Owen is a bit of a free spirit. He gets it from his mom. Is she, uh... back in new Jersey? With the boss? With the b... She, uh... She passed away six months ago. I'm sorry. That's why I brought him here, actually. Thought that camping, new surroundings, maybe... that'd help him take his mind off things, but... I came here looking to start over, too. Hasn't turned out quite the way I'd hoped. Why not? What good's a new life if you don't have anyone to share it with? Hey! I thought we were making dessert! Voila. So... how come you're not a mom? Just didn't work out that way, I guess. It's too bad. You'd be really good at it. Thank you, Owen. So how much longer? Patience. They're almost done. And how are you liking Storybrooke so far? It's way better than New Jersey. You don't miss your home? Your friends? I hate it there. All the kids at my school treat me weird now. Because of what happened to your mother? Nobody gets it. It's like... there's a piece of your heart missing. How's dessert coming? Great. Owen and I were just talking, and... I know this might sound crazy, but... how would you two feel about sticking around town a little longer? Uh... stick around? As in? Move here. I can get you a job at the city, and... there's a great school for Owen. Please, dad, can we? It can be a chance for a new start. Uh... Well... Look, I appreciate everything you've done for us, but our life is in New Jersey. It's not here. Of course. Why did you bring me here? I don't wanna talk to you. You don't have to. Hey, buddy. Saved you a seat.- I'm gonna get a coffee.- Yeah. Here you go. One large sundae. Extra everything. Thanks, Ruby. Extra everything? What? You think I don't know a bribe when I see one? That obvious, huh? So what do you want? Well, your mom had told me about what's been going on, and we thought that Storybrooke might not be the safest place for you right now. So I was thinking... why don't we go to New York? New York? Well, Regina can't cast that curse if you're in New York. There's no magic there. Someone should find a way to get rid of magic here. My mom wouldn't be able to cast the curse. My family wouldn't wanna kill her. It... it'd solve everything. Yeah. You know what? You're right. But until then, why don't you come with me? Thanks, Ruby. Excuse me. Um... could I get this sandwich wrapped up to go? I was thinking about going on a hike. A hike, huh? Well, Dr. Whale said it'd be good for me to get on my feet. And... plus I'm kind of a... nature photography nerd. Just thought you'd be back in Pennsylvania by now. This town's starting to grow on me. Thank you very much. How did it go? Went good. He said yes. Seriously? Yeah, he's in the bathroom right now. I'm just... I'm gonna go home and pack. Not bad for day three as a dad, if I do say so myself. Wait. Where's his backpack? Well, I don't know. He took it with him. To the bathroom? Did you really fall for that? He's son. He's running. Nice try, dearie. Did you really think it was going to be that easy? He can't be your guard dog forever. So what can I do to help, madame mayor? Kurt Flynn's car. Yeah, the one you asked me to fix ASAP. Yes. Plans have changed. I now need Mr. Flynn and his son to stay a while longer. Perhaps you can take a couple extra days with the repairs? I'm afraid that Mr. Flynn already picked the car up. What? When? Ten minutes ago. Sheriff... our visitors are driving out of Storybrooke. Find them before they cross the town line, pull the car over and arrest the father for drunk driving, then bring the boy to me. Kurt. Yeah? That wasn't what it sounded like. Don't want any trouble.- Just came by to say thank you and...- Wait. It was just a misunderstanding. No. I understood. We're leaving. I'm not going to hurt him. Please don't leave. Whoa, mate. What are you doing? Uhh! I'm afraid you're under arrest for driving under the influence. What? Drunk? I'm not drunk, and I sure as hell haven't been driving. Don't make this harder on yourself. What did you do to him? She's controlling you. I don't know how, but she had this glowing thing. It was shaped like a heart. Don't listen to her. And you say you haven't been drinking? What was that? Dad, what's wrong? We need... we gotta get outta here. Whoa! Hey, kid. You all right?- Yeah.- What are you doing out here all by yourself, huh? Boy scout. Trying to get a merit badge. Well, what are you doing out here? I'm hiking. And I'm... I'm taking pictures of Maine's scenic beauty. The hiking trail's that way. Okay. Thanks. Um... Huh. Is it... Henry? Well... good luck with your merit badge. Henry! Henry! Oh, down here. He in here. Why would an 11- year- old kid run away to the mines? Wouldn't be the first time. I think I know what he was looking for. The dynamite the dwarves used for blasting. What the hell would he want dynamite for? To get rid of magic.- Wait. What?- At the diner, he said someone should get rid of magic. So he's gonna... blow it up? Where would he even go to do that? Hello? Hi. Is this Henry's mother? Who's asking?- My name's Greg Mendell.- Who? The guy that crashed his car outside of town. See, I... I was out here hiking in the woods, and... he was by the White Pine Trail, and he was all by himself. Well, what's he doing out there? Is he okay? I... I don't know. He ran off, but he... he seemed a little upset, and I... I just thought that you would want to know. That's... all. I'm on my way. What's going on, dad? What do they want? We're gonna get outta here. Come on! Dad! Look out! Dad! Faster, dad! I think we lost'em. Dad! Aah! All right, listen to me. Run into the woods. Get as far away from here as you can. You call your uncle. Go. No. Not without you. There's a reason I gave you that. Because as long as you have it, I'll always be with you. You can do this. So do it. Run! Go! Go! Run! You might have this whole town wrapped around your finger, but not my son! You can't force him to stay with you! Uhh! Dad! Don't stop! Run! Run! Owen? It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you. Why are you doing this? I just want you to stay with me. You said you liked it here. You wanna stay here, don't you? Not like this. I'm sorry. I just wanted us to be happy. Run, Owen! Henry? What are you doing? I'm getting rid of magic. I... it's ruining everything, and you can't stop me. All that's gonna do is get you killed. You just say that because you need magic. So you can cast that curse on me. I can't lose you, Henry. You mean too much to me. Then don't cast the curse. Don't kill Mary Margaret. Henry, she has to pay. The curse... it won't make me love you for real. It'll be fake. But it will be something. I know it's hard for you to understand right now, but you'll see. We can be happy. We can have everything. Not like this. Hey, Regina! Get away from my son! He's not yours. He's mine. And after I cast this, you'll never see him again. That's never gonna happen. You wanna kill Mary Margaret,- you're gonna have to go through us.- Okay. Stop! Henry, get out of the way! Not until someone helps me destroy magic! There's no way to get rid of it. You can't just blow it up. Magic isn't the problem, kid. It's her. It's not just her. It's everyone. Look what magic did to Mary Margaret. Look at what it did to It's ruining everything. It makes good people do terrible things. And bad people. Please. It's gonna destroy my family. Help me get rid of it. I can't do that, Henry. But there is something I do. Thank you. Here. This is where they took my dad. There's nothing here, kid. No. No. is where Storybrooke was, behind this rock. Son, there isn't a town called Storybrooke anywhere in Maine. So you don't believe me? Look. Now you've been through a lot. Son! I'll find you, dad! I promise! I'll never stop looking! Come on, son. Come on, let's go. It's okay. Okay. That was your husband. It's seems that Henry convinced Regina to destroy the curse, which means my services are no longer required. How do you do it? Do what? Live with yourself, knowing all the bad things you've done. Well, you tell yourself you did the right thing. And if you say it often enough, one day you might actually believe it. Kill me. What? Regina, we have been fighting for so long. It's cost us so much. It has to end before anyone else dies. So... Please... Just do it. Henry would never forgive me. But do you know what my problem is? I never learn from my mistakes. Aah! Aah! Huh. What? Do you see that? What did you do to it? Oh, I didn't do that. did it. You darkened yourself. No. No.- No!- Yes. And once you blacken your heart, it only grows darker and darker. Trust me. I know. So crush it. Do it. Get it over with. And put you out of your misery? I don't need to destroy you. Your doing it to yourself. And along the way, you'll bring down that perfect little family you fought so hard to reunite. And then Henry will be mine. Please kill me.- just kill me.-- You see, I have everything. Thanks to you. Now get off my porch. Aah! I'll find you, dad. I promise. Sync and corrections by atrn97g for www. addic7ed.

{"title": "Spartacus: Blood and Sand Enemies of Rome", "content": "Give report! Spartacus' cavalry has broken our western flank. That fucking savage. Give signal to re- form to the south. [ horse neighing ] Kill him! We must go! Spartacus! The Romans have sounded retreat. We have won the day. We have won nothing. Cossinius and Furius again slip from grasp. The same cannot be said for many that stood with them. The field is thick with the dead. Deserved fate. For all who would see us again to shackle and whip. Another standard lost? It is a grave wound inflicted upon the Republic, Cossinius. A deeper one would have been suffered, had we not withdrawn from battle. It confounds the fucking senses. How could a handful of errant slaves continue to vex us? I fear their numbers have been sorely underestimated within the Senate. with each passing victory, since Glaber's defeat at Vesuvius. They added thousands to rank liberating the mines of Lucania. Slaves across the Republic, humble and grateful to their masters for so many years, have broken to treachery Untold numbers joined his cause after Scrofa fell to him on the banks of the Calor. His standards and fasces falling to the enemy, as the man himself. Such chaos and death at the hands of a fucking slave. You will discover this fucking slave at the very gates of Rome itself, if reinforcements are not dispatched. Lucullus battles Mithridates near the Black Sea. Antonius sails against the pirates plaguing Crete. The resources of the Senate are drained by these conflicts. We have not the men nor the coin to procure them. There is one among us who could fund endeavor from his own purse. I had hoped to avoid involving the man. We would not be beholden to him any more than you, Metellus. Produce alternative, and we shall seize upon it. Very well. I shall return to Rome and entreat Crassus to aid in crushing Spartacus and his rebellion. And in the act, attempt to redress grievous injury inflicted upon the honor of the Republic. The field has been stripped of weapons and horses. The Romans' loss again becomes our bounty. What of Gannicus? I would have his report as well. You well know the man. He favors celebration after a victory. Often for many days. A thing I would gladly give blessing. After Cossinius and Furius fall from concern. They have proven themselves no fools. And may yet attempt bold maneuver. Double our sentries in surrounding hills. I would not be caught unaware. You give those shits credit beyond due. Underestimating your opponent is a Roman trait, Agron. Do not fall prey to it. Cossinius and Furius come to the end of their days. With each passing sun, hundreds of slaves break bond to join our cause. Agron is not wrong in this. Soon we shall have the advantage of numbers. Gauge prowess of all that have joined us, and see them readied. I would strike again at nearest opportunity, and give further warning to the fools in Rome seeking to grind us beneath heel. [ fighting sounds ] Every day for months he wrestles with the man, groans and grunts filling ear. Your father is a dedicated student. And I forced to stand witness to the lessons, while more pressing matters fall to ill attention. Apologies, Dominus. I lose myself in the heat of contest. Less than a scratch. Worse deserved for not anticipating blow. You are quick of study. Yet you open flank to injury when perceived advantage is pressed. The ruin of many a man within the Senate. Let us return to lesson after evening meal is broken. Dominus. The rumors prove true, Crassus. You take instruction from a slave. Hilarus stood a champion of the arena for many years. I paid his lanista more coin than you'll ever see in your life to purchase the man, and impart what he's learned of the games. And of the men who have drawn blood upon the sands. Gladiators. You strike upon very subject of my visit. If we may break word in private? Oh, Tiberius is well trained in the ways of men. I would expose him to those of the Senate as well. To the matter, we've have suffered unexpected complications in our conflict with the rebel Spartacus. Cossinius and Furius have fallen? [ sighing ] Their asses must be sore from the ramming Spartacus has given, to come begging to me. No one is begging. They are asking assistance from a loyal member of the Senate. How much assistance? Ten thousand men. It would take considerable coin and effort to raise such a force. And in return you will be offered a command. An offer better received from the men themselves. They've withdrawn to a villa on the outskirts of Nuceria, within short ride Spartacus continues to gather force in the valley of Campania. You know I would not have come if situation did not demand of it. No. You would not. Their terms are agreeable. I will dispatch message to them immediately. Best I send my own men, to ensure it arrives at intended destination. Whatever your will. To voice truth of it, I had expected you to extort inflated title at the very least, as Pompey did to take his charge against Sertorius. My interest lies only in title and honor earned. Apologies for ever suspecting less. You would agree to serve beneath Cossinius and Furius, absent true command? It would appear so. I have heard how you berate their names, how foolish and vain you think them and Senator Metellus. Father-- The time for words has ended. Spartacus must fall, and I shall set upon what path I must to see day hastened. For the glory of Rome. I saw it with my own fucking eyes! In the heat of battle, blood and brains thick to the knee. And Gannicus, in the middle of it all! Strips to his fucking cock, bellowing to the Romans to kneel before him and receive golden tribute! In my defense, I had taken much wine that day, not expecting Spartacus to turn and attack Scrofa. Nor did that Roman cunt! Spartacus stands a god! His sword cleaving the heavens He is man... like no other. Rome trembles at his name and soon the mighty fucking republic will fall to his fucking wrath- To Spartacus! There is more wine? My friends, are of thirst. Gifts, yes. Not for you. [ chuckling ] Out. Out. It is my fucking tent. Out. We shall find another. Hopefully as well stocked. Is it imagining, or do we rise to heights unknown in wake of battle? As all men do, when bathed in blood and victory. When Rome falls, I fear we shall split the heavens in celebration. And fuck Jupiter as he plummets to the earth. Oh, you believe you fuck as a god now? I boast but upon evidence given. Couple proud words with wine, and see them better received. You afforded yourself well upon the field this day. You stand surprised? I have always believed in you, Nasir. Even when you were yet a contrary little Syrian slave boy. My eyes were yet shrouded. I am forever in Spartacus' debt, for parting veil. A debt shared equally by all. One we shall repay with Roman lives. You summoned me? I would not have had to. If you had reported in with Crixus and Agron days ago. My attentions were called by pressing matters. Of women and drink? Are there any more so? Days can not pass after battle without your report. We fought. We won. Does that cover needed ground? Hmm. You have proven valuable asset against the Romans. Yet I would have you stand more than just another sword. Take rightful place beside Crixus and myself, as a leader. I will give life to your cause, in honor of Oenomaus. I may even believe in it myself upon a day. But I am no leader, nor seek to be one. There are many that already look to you as such. A greater number still would follow you in battle. You mean die for me? For the cause. I would not be set above my brothers, and thought greater than I am. As many begin to think of you. I do not wish it. Yet it is so. They begin to speak of you as a god. And may react poorly when you prove yourself mortal. Victory against the Romans is my only concern. And how is it defined? When Cossinius and Furius struck from this world? You know that will not be the end of it. Rome will send more and more in their wake. Then they too shall fall. And when we have laid waste to the mighty Republic? What will you turn your wrath upon then hmmm? The men that set you on this path, the men that took your wife from you. They are gone from this world. Their wives too, A thousand lives would not equal Sura's. I dared to love a woman once. When I was a slave to Batiatus. She yet draws breath? I would give the world to have it so. A fate too common, for men such as us. I had my vengeance, as you did. And stood as empty. Until Oenomaus forgave betrayal. Oenomaus? It was his wife I lost heart to. Even when freedom was gained, shackles of what I had done to those I loved remained. With final breath, Oenomaus struck chains that bound me. There is no one I hold to heart, left to break such balming words. Absent such, a man must speak them to himself. Words also denied me. You seek them in the voice of thousands, clamoring for blood? I could not save my wife. Nor Mira. Nor many more close to heart you've not known. And I can fight to see a day when no innocent life is so easily disregarded. A day when the Romans and their cruelty are but a distant memory. May you find peace in its arrival, brother. Let us share wine and women, and set aside such heavy fucking thoughts. The offer is much appreciated. Then I will drink and fuck in your name. Fight when called upon. The very steps to the Roman Senate if that is where your madness leads. [ chuckling ] Raise offer to 350 denarii and two iugera of land. We must elevate numbers quickly. I will dispatch Sabinus and see it done. I thought you to bed. Tiberius has filled his ears with talk of war. The battle rages in his head, vanquishing slumber. Is it true? You ride with an army against Spartacus? Yes to defend the Republic, as is the duty of all Romans. I'm a Roman. I will go with you. [ laughs ] Oh, would that you were of an age, to stand by your father's side. Now for your bed, Publius, and dream of future laurels. Yes, father. He would follow you to the shores of the afterlife, if so commanded. As would Tiberius. He will hold place amongst my troops when they march. A place? He deserves position of note, worthy of the name he bears. He does not yet hold the years for the title of Tribune. Coin and persuasion would see such rules set aside--( snapping) He has not earned it. Tiberius has shown great promise as a soldier. Yet he falls from target in strategy and discerning mind. Then lend instruction. My lessons never cease. It is for him to apply them. Your work carries into night? And threatens break of dawn. I shall see food and wine brought. Kore shall tend to my needs. Of course. Your bed awaits. If you find want of it. It is an honor long deserved, to be given command. One he finds beneath Cossinius and Furius. I have never known your father to remain beneath anyone for length of time. Ah, perhaps the years have tempered desire for laurels and adulation of the crowds. And what of your desires? Apollo himself would be set ablaze by them. I shall remember not to stand too near, for fear of melted wings. I would not have you from my side in this, Sabinus. The gods themselves could not wrest me from it. I will see offer raised and numbers elevated. Gratitude. I recall a time when you and Sabinus were but children, playing at war with wooden sticks. Such games are of the past. A thing yet proven to your father. Do not give him cause to further doubt you. Any shall be swept from thought, when I stand awash in the blood of our enemies. [ yelling ] Watch your left! Watch for the swing! Raise fucking guard! Your boy grows fiercer by the day. Soon even I shall fear to call him little man. At least now I will be able to understand you when you yield, you simple shit. [ whispers ]: Spartacus... Begin! Come on! We test the last of those that have joined us. How do you find them? Enthusiastic. Yet short of skill. Many among us once stood as such. These will soon prove as worthy. Perhaps not all. Do not speak of this. Go. Diotimos? If I were? Inside. Quickly. I can spare no more than this, so do not fucking ask. Gratitude, gratitude. You have killed a horse? Lower fucking voice. I would not follow the animal in crush news of meat would bring. Who gave permission? A man atop a horse in battle is valued ten upon foot. He was gravely wounded against the Romans. I would have sought permission from the great man upon the hill, but King Spartacus is far too busy waging war to bother with such low concerns. What moves you to such thoughts? Open fucking eyes you have your answer. I begin to question turning from the calm of the ocean breeze and the safety of my city's walls. You were a free man, then? Far removed. I toiled beneath the heel of a most unpleasant shit in Sinuessa en Valle. Yet he at least provided for fucking needs. Did you expect freedom to come absent cost? No. Yet absent fucking plan to be clothed or fed we must take matters into our own hands. Or risk early grave waiting for the Bringer of Fucking Rain to bless us with much needed shower. [ children yelling ] Weather will soon turn cold, A clutch of Romans ride from the north, attempting to slip past our position. You are Spartacus? Apologies, I- I did-- Still tongue. You may not always have full belly or warm cloak, but while I draw breath you have freedom to speak your heart. Even against the great man upon the hill. Fuck the gods. You there! What is your purpose so near rebel encampment? Who else is with you? Find fucking tongue. Who is with you? Death. Rahh! We must follow. No. A spear. Quickly. I stand your equal with sword. Yet you have me by fucking spear. Spartacus. This one carried a message. Ten thousand? Led by Marcus Crassus Himself. Cossinius and Furius will see their numbers swell, stripping advantage. We could lay trap. Here, upon the Appian Way. Catch them by surprise before they have chance to join their brothers. That would place us between. Crassus advancing from the north and Cossinius and Furius in the south. We do not have the men to face armies on both fronts. We must strike Cossinius and Furius before odds tip to imbalance. We have inflicted nagging wound. Yet for months we have failed to shatter resolve of their men. Perhaps the heads of their commanders carried before us would so sway them. Trophies proven difficult to win. On the field of battle, yes. By what is written here, message was not directed to where their troops lie. It speaks of hope that word finds them safe within the villa. They have gone to ground? Warm bath and the comfort of women, if my days in Rome are of worth. Where is this villa? It does not say. Then we return to beginning. We intercepted Crassus' men here, riding southeast. Cossinius and Furius would seek to stay within reasonable distance of their men. Would place their villa somewhere within this region. How do we divine which is theirs? They are no fools, as you have said. We will know location by placement of sentries. And sizable force they no doubt have without villa to lend protection. Then we descend upon them with every sword we have. No. We risk discovery moving against the villa with large numbers. Cossinius and Furius would be alerted, and have chance to slip again from grasp. Yet a few men might penetrate defense unnoticed... A few against many. Much as the old days. Gannicus, Crixus-- I would have you at my side. I am to stand idle, with arm up fucking ass? You are to lead in my absence. Gather every man and woman that can hold weapon. One of vital importance, if we are to gain victory. It is plan born of fevered mind. As often springs from his brow. Yet if we can see it-- If. A word forever casting shadow. You burn brightly enough to light darkest night. I voice concern and you offer flattery. I offer truth. Your fire blazes to rival the fucking sun. These hands, once trembled with broken memory, now stand as strong as the steel they wield. Because of you. Because your heart is strong. And your will undeniable force, as I have often discovered. I would not be from your side. Nor I yours, but this night it must be so. Stay near to Agron, and follow command. Kill many Romans. And return to my arms with their blood hot upon you. The bodies of the dead be all that greet Crassus and his army. Sword. There is yet much to be done, if we are to move against Spartacus. Hmmm, much. Yet you waste hour sparring with a common slave. Was Spartacus not also once thought of as such? Would you dismiss him so casually as well? No. Yet for all his victories Spartacus is still a slave. He's a man. No better or worse than any sharing title. You would place him upon equal footing with a Roman? In some regards, he's proven to stand even higher. Psst. You believe wealth and position grant you advantage over those beneath you? I believe we tower above a slave in all things, no matter what name he bears. Then couple words with actions, and prove belief. Well, you've been well trained in the Roman ways of combat. Surely you can best a common slave. Apologies, Dominus. I did not mean to... You did but teach lesson sorely needed. As Spartacus schools those who consider themselves gods, perched far above lesser men. And laughs as they tumble from the heavens. There are too many. Even for us. Then let us pause moment. And see numbers thinned. The die has been cast. We cannot reverse throw. There has been no word from Metellus. He takes overly long. And with what haste could we expect reply from Longinus for aid? Cisalpine Gaul lays twice distance than Rome. At least consider dispatching message-- Praetor. The rebel army gathers near our legions in the north. Give Mummius orders for first and second cohorts to move to support them. To fuck with Crassus. We shall rejoin our men and take Spartacus ourselves. Fetch armor and sword! Quickly! Agron's advance on position to the north draws them away. Not all. The gods have heard my prayers. There is no boast in easy victory. Stay to the shadows. And let us end this. He speaks to me as he would a child. Then prove him wrong, and do not pout as one. An army not yet raised to maturity. Preparation for long march and campaign ignored. All in favor of playing with this fucking brute. I do not understand his mind. Set aside wounded pride and think as he would. And see shrouded mystery parted. [ grunting ] Swiftly. Before they are discovered from their post. We do not know how many await inside. Let us pray they are not too few. I am encircled by mad fucks. And begin to count myself as one. The gods favor us. Spartacus holds no belief in them. I pray this night they prove me wrong. Dominus, it takes time to master technique. I well know it can swell frustration. My frustrations lie not with myself. Dominus? If I have done something to offend... The only offense lies in what you do not do. You hold back in your assault. Do you think I'm not worthy of it? As the Senate believes me unworthy of a true command? No, Dominus. None stand more worthy of respect than you. Then see it given. Come at me. As you would an opponent in the arena, absent thought of mercy. Father-- We all have lessons that must learned. I would have this my final test. And in its completion, knowledge that I am readied to face those trained in your arts upon field of battle. You ask me to kill you. I command you to try. Then you command my death. If you're victorious, it will be at the cost of my life. If you fall to my sword, my life is equally forfeit. Tiberius. Bear witness. he's to be rewarded with his freedom You cannot be serious. A man's true enemy is doubt. A thing I would not carry into battle against Spartacus. Make choice. Your will, Dominus. My hands. First and second garrison ride to join the legion. Spartacus does not hold the numbers for decisive victory. What is his mind in such attack? Let us see his skull split open, and read his fucking thoughts upon the ground-- [ yelling ] Spartacus. Stay together. You must stop this. He has given command. It must be obeyed. Come on! We must see you to safety. I will not fucking turn from him again. Seize reason. We will return with more men and see Spartacus to his fate. Don't let them away! Go! You were waiting... for me to think you'd made misstep I warned you of... Knowledge and patience. The only counter to greater skill. You have been well schooled. Know that your service will not pass unremembered. [ groaning ] The coin I promised had you bested me shall be set towards monument to the storied gladiator Hilarus. It has been the greatest of honors to have served you, Dominus.( soft) The honor was mine. Fucking savages have blocked us from egress. Take shelter here. I will not fall trapped as fucking animal. [ yelling ] Your cause is lost. The mistake is mine. In not foreseeing you would attack in the night, as the thieves and cutthroats you prove. A mistake you shall not make again. Name terms of surrender, There are none I would trust a Roman to honor. Gather their heads. A most ill- fated turn. And yet news of calamity does not end with their deaths. Absent proper command, I fear Cossinius and Furius' men will soon be scattered to the winds. Yes it was most unfortunate their leaders fell before my arrival. Even more unfortunate that your messenger appears to have taken routes that passed so near the rebel encampment. Give plain voice. If you're of a mind. Let us move from clouded past and turn eye towards pressing future. Sole command and charge to bring Spartacus to deserved end is now yours. Along with title of Imperator, if you so wish it. I serve the glory of Rome.( sourly) As do we all. You planned this. From the moment Metellus offered command under Cossinius and Furius. The House of Crassus bows to no one. How did you know Spartacus would make attempt on their lives, instead of fleeing when knowledge was gained of your army advancing from Rome? Because it is what I would have done. Mummius and the last of the Romans flee to the west. Sight of their leaders' heads upon pike has broken fucking spirit. Let us give chase, and see them all to equal fate. We have won our victory. I would see us far from here in advance of Crassus and his army. The mighty Spartacus turns from unwinnable fight? Our numbers have grown beyond wildest expectation. Yet winter will soon be upon us. To face hunger and cold as well as Crassus would drag us to certain doom. We must seek advantage of supplies and shelter. One that can be defended if set upon, until spring warms intent. There is not a villa in all the lands that could hold such numbers. No, there is not. Only a city could hold us now.

It's a group of doctors who go to third world countries. He wants me to go with him. I've written a note. It explains why you want her to stay... and why you needed to leave without saying good- bye. I'll bet there's a legal way to get Miguel in the country. I get to rescue the little Mexican boy, not you. And to think you wanted me to wait. What? This is where Adrian used to videotape Flora having sex. Marisol's real name is Suarez. She's the mother of the boy that the police arrested. This woman... She's trying to hurt me. Will I need a gun? Call 911! Now!( Siren wailing) What do we got? Female, early thirties, gunshot wound to the abdomen, B. P. is 80 over 40.- Pulse?- 120. Respiratory rate 12. Bay two. Get moving. Doctor! Doctor! I thought you should know my wife. She's pregnant. We'll do what we can.( Door opens and closes)( Sighs) I spoke to the doctor. Did he tell you? I am so sorry.( Voice breaks) I always wanted a little girl.( Sighs)- Michael, I hate to ask.- Then don't. I need to know. Did Phillipe frame my son for murderer? I won't discuss that.- Why are you still protecting him?- I'm not. He will pay for this. But what about Flora? If he's responsible for her death... Nothing I could tell you about that can be used against him. Don't you get it? It'd be throwing away my career, and you still wouldn't be able to touch Phillipe!( Taylor, weakly) Michael? Hey. I thought you were sleeping.( Whispering) Tell her. What? Tell Marisol what she needs to know.( Lowered voice) Honey, I'm his lawyer. I can lose my license to practice. That man killed our baby.( Sighs) Where should I start? Tell me about the night Flora Hernandez was murdered. 1. 13- Totally Clean Sync& Corrections by www. addic7ed. com Odessa! Welcome home. It's so good to see you. How are you feeling? The doctors say she's made a full recovery. Is it nice to be back? The house is filthy. You haven't gone inside yet. I can just tell.( Mouth full) Oh, my God.( Fork clinks)- What do you call this?- Chilaquiles. You like? Very much. You want more? I've got plenty. Maybe just a little.( Chuckles) You sure are spoiling me lately. Why shouldn't I? Everything you've done for Miguel and me. My pleasure. He's such a nice boy.( Cell phone rings) Oh, that's my phone. Sweetie, can you bring me my tel\u00e9fono? Por favor?( Ring)( Ring)( Ring) And he does just what I tell him. I love that.( Beep) Hi. Yeah, I'm on my way. What smells so good? Rosie made the most delicious breakfast. Mwah! I'd have more, but I gotta run.( Footsteps retreat) So...( Door opens) Can I have a plate of that?( Door closes)( Thuds) All gone.( Pan clatters) How many times can I say,\" I'm sorry\"?- Never enough for what you did.- I admit it. I tried to stop Peri from bringing Miguel here, but only because I didn't want you to feel you owed her something. Well, I do. I owe her everything. Right! I knew it would be better for our relationship if you owed me. What?! You know what I mean. I wanted to bring Miguel here because I wanted to show you how much I loved you. We've been together for months. And you never got him. Maybe you don't love me as much as you think.( Sighs)( Door closes) Hey, guys! Good morning, Valentina. It's so nice to see you. What are you doing here? I've been trying to reach Remi all morning. He won't pick up. Oh, he's probably just sleeping in. Go knock on his door. I want to show Valentina my wedding dress.( Gasps)( Chuckles)-( Chuckles)-( Gasps) Pretty. But why such a thick veil? It'll be my fourth wedding in this church.

So you heard about the big news. I have. Did you know Alejandro was gay? Didn't have a clue. I wish I had. It would have made things easier. Easier? This may shock you, but... Alejandro is not just a friend to me. I have feelings for him. I'm not shocked. I kept thinking maybe one day he would notice me, but... he never did. Now you know why.( Chuckles) Honestly, it's a relief.( Chuckles) If I can't have him, at least no other woman will take my place.( Chuckles) Are you ready for lunch? I made you paella. Mm. It's too spicy. You haven't tasted it yet. Mm. I can just tell.- I love this detail.- I've never seen that. Remi's not in his room. He's not? All his things are gone. I found these notes on his pillow. There's one for each of you. Oh, my God. What is it? He went to Africa. He left last night. He says he wants to help vaccinate people in the Congo. Sounds like the worst vacation ever. I don't think it's a vacation. Oh, my God. You're right. He says he'll be gone for a whole year. Valentina, did you know about this? He told her he wanted to join doctors doing humanitarian work. Then he asked her to go with him. Then why would he leave without telling her? This doesn't sound like Remi.- I need to call him.- He's not answering his phone.- Remember?- Oh. Well, then I'll just leave a message for him at his hotel. Is there a Mandarin Oriental in the Congo? I don't know. I don't understand this. Africa of all places. If he wanted to help poor people, why couldn't he just go to Burbank?( Footsteps retreat) What does your note say? It doesn't matter. Excuse me. Uh, next up... The Lamborghini. I want that. No, you don't. I do. I really do. It has a stick shift.- I'll hire a chauffeur.- I said no. She gave you the Picasso. I just had the upholstery redone... in mohair. The seats are so soft.- She's doing it out of spite.- Okay. Okay. For God sakes, Evelyn. What would you ever do with a Lamborghini? Well... I suppose I could have my new chauffeur drive me to your house. And then once we were parked just beneath your bedroom window, my new chauffeur and I could make love on your mohair upholstery. Or if you feel that's spiteful, I- I really don't know what to tell you.( Door opens) Excuse me. Have you guys heard the news? We're in a meeting, Rickey. I'm so sorry, but... Michael Stappord's wife was shot.- What?!- Yeah, it's on the news.- She's in the hospital.- Do they know who did it? No. It was like a sniper or something. Oh, my God!- You know the Stappords, don't you?- We do. And I hear Taylor lost the baby.( Man) I didn't even know she was pregnant.( Woman) They had just found out. Well, we've got to send a card or some flowers or something.( Woman) I'll chip in if you add my name to the card. Oh, absolutely. Now I got to tell Mr. Hemstead what happened.( Crying) Adrian? We're going home now. Uh... Shall we reschedule? We'll call you later.( Glasses clatter) In other news, a woman is in critical condition after she was shot last night in front of her Beverly Hills home. 31- year- old Taylor Stappord suffered a single gunshot wound to the abdomen. Police are calling the attack\" bizarre and unmotivated.\" A spokesman for the department says the suspect is still at large. Wall Street is riding high after yesterday's big rally... Well, if you do hear anything, please tell him to call his mother.( Sighs) Thank you.( Telephone beeps and clatters) I talked to all of Remi's friends, and no one knew what he had planned. Well, he's a grown man. He'll be fine. But to just run off like that... I don't understand it. I do. Yeah, there's something to be said for... leaving your responsibilities behind and... starting a new adventure. What are you thinking? Let's elope. What? I feel the need to be alone with you in some exotic locale. That does sound romantic. When would we leave? Tonight. Well, now you're just being silly. What about our engagement party?- Oh, that. Well...-( Chuckles) We could go after the party? Are you sure you don't want to get married in Beverly Hills? It will affect the quality of gifts we receive. We have each other. We don't care about material things anymore. Oh. You'll have to remind me of that from time to time. So you'll pack your bags? Of course.( Chuckles) So... where do we want to go? I've always wanted to visit Brunei. That's where my business manager went. You know, the man who stole all my money?- Really?- Oh, yes. Apparently, we don't have an extradition treaty with Brunei. You don't say. Hmm. Yeah, till she says no, but she's not gonna say... You wanted to see me? Come in, Carmen. I want to introduce you to my team. This is Roger, my publicist, Max, my agent. And Gary is my... my lawyer. Guys, this is Carmen... my maid. Alejandro tell us you're a very talented singer. That's nice of you.( Chuckles) He also tell us that you're very ambitions.( Chuckles) Why would you tell them that? As you know, Alejandro's private life has recently become grist for the tabloid mill.- So?- So... We have a proposition for you. As you can see, the contract is rather straightforward. And this is all guaranteed. We will produce your album. And then you'll go on tour, appear on talk shows... And, of course, you'll be paid. It's everything you've ever wanted. If I pretend to be your wife. You will be his wife. The ceremony will be legal.( Max) But it'll just be for two years. And then you'll have irreconcilable differences, and it'll all be over. You divorced your first husband for the same reasons. No one will even think twice.( Papers rustle)- What about Sam?- What about Sam? We're supposed to move in together. Um... you won't be able to date, not while you're married to Alejandro. What if I saw him... secretly? It's risky. The tabloids are always watching. So you're asking me to give him up? It's just for two years. And think of what you're getting in return. This is a favor to me... obviously. And if you say\" no,\" we're cool. But if you do this, people will hear you sing. You can finally share your music with the world.( Max) So what do you say, Carmen? Are you ready to be famous? Can I talk to you? I'm busy. Please. I have something important I want to say. I know everything that you will say, and none of it is important. You know that I want to marry you.- And I have said\" no.\"- Rosie... It does not matter how much you love me. I have to do the right thing, and there is nothing you can say that will change my mind. And I also want to adopt Miguel.( Cell phone rings)( Ring)( Beep)( Miguel) Hola? Hey, Miguel. It's Mrs. Westmore. I need to talk to your mother about dinner tonight. Give the tel\u00e9fono to your mamacita. Okay. Think of it. If you marry me and I adopt Miguel, he'd be an American citizen and no one could ever deport him. And we would be a family. Can you imagine a more perfect life? It sounds wonderful. So? I cannot humiliate Mrs. Peri. But I would make you happy for the rest of your life. There is a reason why they call it, um...\" Doing the right thing.\" Because it is always very hard to do. I understand.( Rosie chuckles, sniffles) You're a good person. That's why I fell in love with you. And you're a good man. That's why I love you. Mami?( Gasps)( Sniffles) Mijo, you found my phone.( Beep)( Speaks Spanish) Hey, hey. It's moving day. Let me guess. You haven't started packing yet.( Chuckles) That is so typical. But...( Box thuds) No worries. I will help you. What's with the velvet box? And if the first album sells over 100, 000 copies, the label is contractually obligated to produce the second one.( Chuckles) Of course, even if the album is a huge hit, the marriage will be done in two years. That's definite. So I guess what I'm asking is... Are you willing to... to wait for me?( Chuckles) Sure. Really?! Of course.( Exhales deeply) I'm more than happy to put my life on hold for two years while you enter into a fake marriage with a celebrity. I mean what guy wouldn't agree to that?- Okay, hold on...- But I suppose the men with at least a molecule of self- respect might have an issue with this. But we both know that I'm a loser and I'll agree to anything. Right?- Sam, you're not a loser.- Oh. Well, in that case... I know. I know it's a lot to ask, but these people are offering me everything I've ever wanted! I thought I was what you wanted!- Well, you are, of course.- You just said that two days ago. You want me... More than a career, more than success. Which is it, Carmen? I want it all. You can't have it all. You're gonna have to choose.( Scoffs) Sam. Come here. Sam, Sam! Sam, please! Sam, wait! Wait! Sam, let's talk about this.( Door slams)( Odessa and Alejandro arguing indistinctly)( Odessa) Why do you have to go that far?! It doesn't make any sense!( Alejandro) It... it is for my career.( Odessa and Alejandro continue arguing indistinctly) Odessa, Odessa, it's already final.- I don't understand!- Stop it! What is going on? I told Odessa we were getting married, and she freaked out. I don't know what's going on. Listen, I... Uvas.( Thuds) Mango.( Thuds) So... Do you want some new outfits? I thought we could go shopping later.( Sighs) Honey... I know you're sad about Remi. But he'll be back. And you'll pick up where you left off. Why would you think that? Because... he adores you. I don't think he does. You're wrong. It's like you said. Why would a boy like Remi love me? I'm nothing. Remi loves you very much. I know this. How?( Sighs) Because I saw the look on his face when I asked him to write you that note. What? It was me. I begged him to go without you. He didn't want to go.( Voice breaking) Oh, my God.- I'm so... I'm so sorry.- Oh, my God. Sweetheart! Wait. No! Wait! Wait! Wait! I was only trying to protect you. Don't touch me!( Buttons clicking)( Beep)( Cell phone chimes)( Cell phone chimes)( Cell phone chimes)-( Rosie) Marisol!- Hey.( Carmen) We got your text. We're in absolute shock. How is Taylor?- She's gonna be okay.-( Rosie) Thank God.- Did you see what happened?- I was inside the house. So this was an accident, right? Why would anybody want to shoot Taylor Stappord? Actually... I think they were trying to shoot me. Are you kidding? No. Why would anybody want to shoot you? Because of what I know, what I've learned. What are you talking about? My real name... is Marisol Suarez. And I'm not a maid. But you work for the Stappords. I've seen you take out their trash. Actually, I'm a college professor. And I only took this job to become friends with all of you. Why? So I could learn everything you knew about Flora Hernandez. That boy that killed Flora?- His name was Suarez.- Yes, Eddie is my son. But he didn't kill nobody. He was framed. You knew about this? Oh, oh, no. No. I have evidence. That's what I've been doing for the past weeks... learning about Flora's life. And lying to us. Guys, come on. So if your son didn't kill Flora Hernandez, who did? I think it was Phillipe Delatour. But I'm gonna need help from all of you to prove it. The caterers should be doing that. Oh, it's all right. I need to keep busy. If you need any help... I won't. But thank you.( Phillipe) Anybody home?! Ah!( Chair scrapes floor) The man of the hour. Your housekeeper told me I'd find you both back here. Shouldn't you be at home getting ready for the party? I'll just be here for a moment. I have a little favor to ask. Oh? As soon as the party is over, I want to take Genevieve out of town for a romantic getaway. That sounds lovely. How can we help? I was wondering if I could borrow your jet. Obviously I'd pay for the fuel. We don't really loan the jet. Well, I could pay you, you know, whatever you need. Then you could lease a plane. Uh, it's such short notice. Or fly commercial. No, it has to be private. Something happened? Not at all. Uh, just trying to do something nice for Genevieve. Well, as... as much as we would like to help, Oh, there's no need to apologize. You're throwing us an engagement party, for heaven's sake. So we'll, uh, see you at 7: 00? Okay. I'm so glad you ordered dahlias again. They're my favorite. Again? Don't you use them at all your parties? I've only used dahlias once before, actually... The night our maid was murdered. Well... I didn't go to that party. So... you must have used them before. Perhaps. Okay. I'll see you tonight.( Door closes) What a liar. He's not interested in a romantic getaway. He needs to leave town for some reason. That's not all he lied about. He was here the night Flora was killed. What? I saw him...- in the hallway.- Well, that was months ago. How can you remember something like that? Because I didn't invite him. He and Genevieve were... were not on speaking terms. I was so annoyed. Why would Phillipe lie about something like that? I don't know. Unless... What? Did you ever involve Phillipe in your disgusting little hobby? Oh, my God.- I say we go to the cops.- We can't. But Phillipe confessed. To Michael Stappord... His lawyer. Nothing Phillipe says to him can be used against him in a court of law. Well, I have to tell Genevieve. I can't let her marry a murderer. If Phillipe knows we're on to him, he will leave town, and my son will stay in jail. No. We have to keep quiet until I have absolute proof. But how are we gonna do that? Tonight is the Delatours' engagement party, right? Yeah. It's at the Powells' house. Call Genevieve. Tell her you're worried that the caterers haven't hired enough people for the party. Luckily, you have a few friends who are willing to help out. He had no right! None whatsoever. She was mine. Flora belonged to me. And Phillipe took her from you. She told me she had been attacked, but I didn't believe her. How could you? She was a liar. She also showed me a tape of a meeting with Michael. How he offered her money. She seemed so... calculating, so manipulative... She was manipulative. That's what got her killed. I hate Phillipe. I want him to suffer for what he's done. Is that wrong of me? Evil is the thing that takes away the people we love. It took our son. And it took Flora. No. It is never wrong to punish evil. I want to be careful. I don't want to get caught. Don't worry. I'll help you. You would be willing to do this? This morning you wanted to divorce me. Love can't seem to unite us. Why not try hatred? Valentina? I know you're in there. Please let me in. Listen, I have to leave for the party now. But when I get home, we'll talk about what I've done, and then... I will beg for your forgiveness. And I hope with all my heart you will give it to me. Okay?( Playing jazz)( Laughs) We agree.- Hey.- Oh.( Applause continues) So... what do you think? Everything is absolutely exquisite. I think it's going to be a memorable evening. You have no idea. Zoila! You look stunning! Well, look at you. Doesn't she look stunning? Yes, she does. She really does. Thank you, Phillipe.( Genevieve) Oh, you made it.( Indistinct conversations)( Laughter)- Hors d'oeuvre?- Thank you.( Song ends, applause)( Gasps)( Gasps) Evelyn. What are you doing here? I was... asked to work the party. By whom? Uh... It doesn't matter. You have to leave. Security! Listen...( Whispers) Excuse me.- We have to do it now.- Already? Evelyn's seen me. We don't have much time. I'll tell the girls. And a C. E. O. Phillipe knows is lending us his private jet. We leave tonight after the party. Mm. Brunei sounds like fun. Phillipe was joking we may not come back for years.( Clinks)( Both chuckle) Later, when you have a moment, come find me. I have a gift for you. You and Evelyn have done too much for us as it is. Well, this gift is just from me, and... it's only for you. Mr. Delatour? People are asking if you'd like to say something to the crowd. That'd be great. I'd love to say a few words. We thought you might. If I could have everyone's attention, please, I think it's time to hear from our guests of honor... the Delatours!( Chuckles)( Cheering) Thank you. Thank you. So... Genevieve and I are getting married.-( Woman) Again.- It is a miracle to me that this amazing woman is giving me a second chance. But I'm a changed man. And I'm gonna do everything I can to... To make her happy. And he's off to a good start.( Chuckles) Have you seen the ring?( Woman whoops, cheering) Thank you all so much for coming this evening.( Applause continues) I just want to tell you how happy I am for you. And I am ready to give you and Phillipe my blessing.- Oh, Zoila!- Oh!( Chuckles) Oh...( Screams)( Glass shatters) Oh, my God! I'm so sorry! We need to get some water on this before it sets. I'll be right back.( Zoila) Come on, come on, let's get this dry.( Indistinct conversations) So what does this woman look like? She's 5'6\", 120 pounds, and... vaguely ethnic.( Door slams)( Metal clinks)( Door creaks) Do you know who I am? Oh, yes. Do you know who I am? You're the mother of the boy who killed that maid. Her name was Flora Hernandez, and my son didn't kill anyone. Ah, yes, well... I hear you've been asking some unpleasant questions about me.( Beeps) And I've been getting some interesting answers. From whom? Michael Stappord. He's my lawyer. He can't talk about me. And yet... he did. He told me about Adrian arranging for you to sleep with Flora. But when she found out you were Remi's father, she refused... because she was dating your son. But you're not the kind of man who likes to take\" no\" for an answer.( Crying) Weeks later, you found out she was carrying Remi's child, and she was demanding millions to keep it quiet. So you came here... to a party you weren't invited to. The waiters thought you were just another guest in a tux. That's why they didn't notice when you took the knife.( Scrapes) You then went looking for Flora. And you found her.( Screams) Even though you had stabbed her, somehow Flora managed to get away. But before you could follow her, my son walked in... At the wrong moment. so you hit him.( Thuds) And put the knife in his hand. And my son was blamed for the death of a girl he loved.( Sobbing) I stabbed her... The next day, you told Michael what happened, and he kept your secret.( Continues sobbing) Until the bullet you intended for me... killed his unborn child. These are pathetic... lies. I have evidence, and I'm going to the D. A. tomorrow.( Sighs)( Under breath) Come on. Say something. Then why tell me?( Scoffs) What? If I'm so dangerous, why would you be here with me? Do you want money? Is that it? No. I just wanted to see your face, to see if you could appreciate the irony. Irony? You took the life of a maid, and now a maid is going to take yours.( Whispers) I don't think so.( Zings)( Gasps) There she is!( Clinks) Sorry, ma'am... but you're gonna have to come with me. I am so sorry. I hope she wasn't bothering you? Uh, not at all.( Chuckles)( Clacks and chimes) Zoila, I have to find Phillipe! Please stop dabbing me. You have... There's still a little left.( Sighs) Hey, look over there.( Indistinct conversations)( Sighs)( Clinks) There he is. Adrian. Listen, uh... Genevieve and I will have to be going. Not so fast. I have a gift for you.- Remember?- I really don't have the time. We've got a jet waiting for us. Don't be rude. I put a lot of thought into this gift.( Men speaking indistinctly) Nothing on that tape comes close to a confession. How am I ever gonna get Eddie out of jail?( Sighs)( Gulps) So... Where is this gift? Actually, what I have to offer comes in the form of advice. Adrian, I told you we...( Exhales) Is there something wrong? Just, I don't feel so good.( Sets down glass) My advice is this... The trick to getting away with murder is not to let people think it was murder in the first place. What? You must create a plausible explanation for an unexpected death. Such as suicide.( Gasping)( Faintly) What... What did you do? Not much is needed. Something undetectable in a glass... to relax the muscles.( Gasps) And a witness to the victim's last words.( Voice trembles) Uh, I don't understand.( Gasps) You killed my maid, you son of a bitch. Don't you know how hard it is to find good help? Has anybody seen Phillipe?( Guests gasping and murmuring) Aah!( Indistinct conversations)( Siren wailing in distance) And then he shouted something to the effect that he had murdered Flora Hernandez and couldn't live with himself anymore.( Evelyn) And then he jumped out the window. We were absolutely stunned. It was just the two of you in the room? There were no other witnesses to this proclamation? What are you getting at? Well, according to your party guests, he was only in the water for a minute. But when they pulled him out, he was already dead. That's odd.( Rosie) Uh, we heard it, too. We were in the hall outside that room...( Carmen) Picking up napkins and... and glasses. I was looking for a bathroom. And we all heard a man yell,\" I killed Flora Hernandez.\" And then there was a splash. Go call the D. A. He's gonna want to know about this.( Laughter)( Speaking indistinctly) Sync& corrections by www. addic7ed.

{"title": "Teen Wolf Motel California", "content": "I can't believe Derek's dead. We stay out of it. They're trying to kill my friends. How do I stay out of that? Your father locked you in a freezer in the basement- to punish you.- [ Screams ] I have no clue how I ended up finding that body. So, you literally just showed up there. Yeah. [ Gasps ] [ Dramatic music ]\u266a\u266a [ Tires screech ] [ Tires screech ] [ Bell jingles, door creaks ] [ Door creaks ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Suspenseful music ]\u266a\u266a [ Exhales ] [ Speaking French ] [ Gunshot ] [ Bus creaking ] [ Engine turns off ] I've seen worse. Where have you seen worse? [ Blows whistle ] Listen up. The meet's been pushed till tomorrow. This is the closest motel with the most vacancies and least amount of good judgment when it comes to accepting a bunch of degenerates like yourselves. You'll be pairing up. Choose wisely. And I'll have no sexual perversions perpetrated by you little deviants. Got that? Keep your dirty little hands to your dirty little selves! Lydia? I don't like this place. I don't think the people who own this place like this place. It's just for a night. [ Dramatic music ] A lot can happen in one night. [ Exciting music ]- synced and corrected by chamallow-- www. addic7ed. com-\u266a\u266a [ Sighs ] All right, so I have four. Four? You have four suspects? Yeah, it was originally ten. Well, nine technically, I guess. I had Derek on there twice. So who's number one? Harris? Just because he's missing doesn't mean he's dead. So if he's not dead, our chemistry teacher is out secretly committing human sacrifices. Yeah, I guess that just sounded way better in my head. Well, what if it's somebody else from school? Like, you remember Matt? We didn't know that he was killing people. Excuse me? I'm sorry, what? I... yes, we did. I called that from day one, actually. Yeah, but we never really seriously thought that it was Matt. I was serious. I was quite serious, actually. Deadly serious. No one listened to me.- Who were the other three?- Derek's sister, Cora. No one knows anything about her, and she's Derek's sister. Next, your boss.- My boss?- Yeah, your boss. I don't really like the whole Obi- Wan thing he's got going on, you know. It freaks me out. Oh, my God. I swear, if we make it back alive, I will watch the movie.- Just makes me crazy.- Who was the last one? [ Sighs ] Lydia. She was totally controlled by Peter, and she had no idea, so... [ Sighs ] [ Suspenseful music ]\u266a\u266a Oh, God. This is a bad, very bad idea. I should be taking you to a hospital. No, no hospital. Derek, I can't... I can't hold you anymore. I'm losing you. Derek? [ Whispers ] Derek. Derek... [ Dramatic music ]\u266a\u266a [ Concrete shattering ] [ Suspenseful music ]\u266a\u266a Yo. [ Coins dropping ] Hey. That was the same thing I was gonna get. Oh, hang on. You know what? I got a patented method for this. Don't worry. [ Glass clatters ] [ Water running ] Lydia, did you get the new towels? Lydia... What are you doing? Looking for you. You found me... In the shower. Slightly naked, if you didn't notice. I've seen you naked before. Okay, well... remember, we're kind of not together anymore. We're still friends, right? We could just be closer friends. Maybe... it could even fix things between us. Scott. What are you doing? Are you okay? Yeah, I was, um... sorry, I don't remember. Excuse me? The card on the dresser says we have a non- smoking room, but somehow all of our towels reek of nicotine. Sorry about that, sweetheart. What's that? That number? It's a kind of inside thing for the motel. My husband insists on keeping it up. What do you mean? It's a little bit morbid, to be honest. You sure you want to know? Tell me. We're not gonna make the top of anyone's list when it comes to customer satisfaction. Obviously. But we are number one in California when it comes to one disturbing little detail. Since opening, more than any other motel in California, we have the most guest suicides. 198? And counting. [ Laughs ] [ Remote clicking ] Do you want me to come pick you up? I don't mind a late night drive. No, no. It's okay. We're at a motel.- The school paid for that?- Yeah, yeah. It's not great, but it's just for a night. What's it called? The Glen Capri. Do you know it? Yeah, it... sounds familiar. Listen, sweetheart, I'm gonna hop in the car and come and get you guys. No, dad. Seriously, it's okay. If there's something you feel like you can't tell me, I just want you to know you can talk to me. We don't have to keep anything from each other. I know. [ Suspenseful music ]\u266a\u266a [ Gasps ] [ Gasps ] Oh, my God. How bad? To be honest, the\" oh, my God\" would be for your unbelievable physique if it weren't for the fact that you're bleeding black blood.- [ Grunts ]- Derek... Oh, God, you're not dying, are you? Derek, please don't die. Derek! [ Heart beating steadily ] [ Sighs ] Not exactly how I imagined our first date. 198? Yes, and we're talking 40 years. On average, that's... 4. 95 a year, which is... actually expected. But who commemorates that with a framed number? Who does that? Who?- All suicides?- Yes. Hanging, throat- cutting, pill- popping, both- barrels- of- a- shotgun- in- the- mouth suicides. I don't know about you, but me, I... Which... which one do you want? Did you hear that? Hear what? I don't know. The smaller one, I guess. It's okay. Smaller's better. There's less kick. I'll chamber the round.- All right, so...- Wait, wait. When do I... I mean, do you count? Yeah, yeah, I'll... I'll... I'll count to three. So after three or on three? You tell me.- [ Shudders ]- Lydia?- One, two...- Oh, my God, oh, my God.- Then pull the trigger.- Oh, my God.- I love you.- I love you too. One, two. [ Simultaneous gunshots ] [ Gasping ] What is it, Lydia? What happened?- Did you hear that?- Hear what? The two people in the other room... they shot each other. [ Panting ] Lydia. [ Door creaks ] Hello? [ Flips light switch ] Lydia, what are you doing? Hello? [ Eerie music ]\u266a\u266a It had to be right here. It was a guy and a girl, and, I mean, they sounded younger, but... they were here. I believe you. After everything we've been through, I believe you. [ Distant screaming ] Don't. Don't leave me. You weren't supposed to leave me. Alicia? Why did you leave me? Alicia? [ Gasps ] You know, there is something seriously wrong with this place. Hey, Allison, we need to leave. But they were suicides, not murders, and it's not like this place is haunted, right? Maybe it is. You know, I bet that couple made their suicide pact in that very room. Maybe that's why they're renovating. Maybe they've been scraping brain matter off the wood paneling. Maybe we should find out. [ Metal clanging ] Boyd? [ Footsteps ] [ Clatter ] [ Footsteps ] Hand me the 7/ 16 wrench. What the hell? This is the 9/ 16, you moron. You know what the difference between a seven and a nine is, dumb- ass? You know what the difference between a seven and a nine is? It's a stripped bolt. A stripped bolt. I'm sorry, I didn't...- What do you want me to do?- I want you to shut up. I want you to shut up. Shut up, shut up. What can I do? I can't fix this now. I can't fix this now. I can't fix it. I can't fix it. I can't even keep it closed.- Grab the chains.- What? Grab the chains. Get in. I said, get in. Are you not hearing me, son? Get in the damn freezer! Get in! [ Eerie music ] [ Screams ] [ Buzzer ] Well, there goes that. Didn't you say the sign said 198? It was 198. I swear to God it was 198. Okay, what does that mean, that there's been three more suicides? Or three more are about to happen. [ Ominous music ] [ Musical ringtone ] Hey, mom, what's up?- Mom?- Scott? Mom, what's wrong? [ Crying ] I'm sorry, he just came in the house. I tried to stop him. I'm sorry. Who, mom? Mom, where are you? Outside. Look outside. Scott... can you hear me? What do you want? Isn't it obvious? You're an Alpha now, Scott. I'm not. I'm not. Derek... Derek could still be alive.- He could...- He's dead. You know he is, so now I'm coming for you. You and everyone you love. I'm coming for all of them. Hey, Scott, you okay? [ Phone vibrates ] [ Music playing ]\u266a\u266a Sorry. It's just books. [ Chuckles ] You brought homework? Well, should I let you get back to it? Hell no.\u266a\u266a What's that? I have two of them, from a surgery I had to correct misshapen cartilage I was born with. I had a bar put in when I was 14. It stayed there for two years to support my sternum, so my heart and lungs wouldn't be crushed. Well, what if there was a way you could make them disappear? I don't really want them to. They make me feel like a survivor. I really hope you are.\u266a\u266a What, what's wrong?- Nothing.- What? Just give me a second. [ Breathing heavily ] [ Groaning ] Ethan, you okay? I'll be back in a minute. Last time I saw Scott act like that- was during the full moon.- Yeah, I know. He was definitely a little off with me too, but actually, it was Boyd who was really off. I watched him put his fist through the vending machine. See, it is the motel. Either we need to get out of here right now, or... someone needs to learn how to do an exorcism asap, before the werewolves go crazy and kill us. Okay, just hold on, all right? What if it's not just the motel? The number in the office went up by three, right? You mean like three sacrifices? What if this time it's three werewolves? Scott, Isaac, and Boyd. Maybe we were meant to come here. Exactly! So can we get the hell out of here now? Please? Wait, hang on. Let me see this. What is that?\" 28year- old man hangs himself at the infamous Glen Capri.\" [ Suspenseful music ]\u266a\u266a Oh, no. Look at these two. They both mention the room 217. These are probably all the suicides that happened in this room. So if every room has a Bible... There could be articles in all the rooms. That's a beautiful thing. Most places leave a mint under the pillow. This one leaves a record of all the horrible deaths that occurred. What if the room next door has the one about the couple? [ Dramatic music ]\u266a\u266a No, that was not locked before. Forget it. We need to get Scott, Isaac, and Boyd out of here. [ Electric whirring ] I'm not the only one who heard that, am I? It sounds like someone turned the handsaw on. Handsaw? Hey, no, Ethan, don't! [ Both grunting ] [ Panting ] [ Shouting ] [ Sizzling ] Aah! What just happened? Ethan! [ Groans and pants ] Are you sure you want to do that? I have to find the others. They think I'm dead. Well, maybe that's a good thing. You know how many characters in literature use a false death to their advantage? They need to know. Do you have any idea how bad you look? You're like one giant open wound. I'm not entirely sure you aren't really dead. Didn't you hear what I just said? I don't know how I got there or what I was doing. Okay, you could be a little bit more helpful, you know? We did just save your life. And you probably shouldn't have.- What now?- I'll find Scott. You guys grab Isaac and Boyd. The best thing we can do is get them out of this place. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Oh, no, I w... [ Mumbles ] Stiles. [ Sighs ] All right, Lydia. I didn't want to say anything, but this... everything we're going through... we've kind of been through something like this before, a lot like this. What do you mean? When? Your birthday party, the night you poisoned everyone with wolfsbane. [ Radio clicks on, static buzzing ] [ Static resumes ] Do you remember what time it was when you last saw her? I don't know. I can't remember. Sometimes it helps to put yourself right back in the moment. Imagine you're seeing Alicia skating on the ice rink. Plenty of other people around, and then what? And then she was just... she was just gone. [ Static resumes ] I told you, I was watching her. I didn't want to skate anymore. I was tired, and I swear, I was watching her. It's all right, Vernon. We're just trying to piece together what happened. [ Static resumes ] Is she dead? Is it my fault? Is she dead? Is she dead? Is it my fault? Is she dead? You don't have any bandages or any kind of first aid anywhere. I looked. I usually don't need them. How do we fix you up? Time. You shouldn't be here. Why's that? Because you don't know me. You don't know anything about me. Maybe I have a feeling about you. It shouldn't be a good one. Everyone around me... everyone gets hurt. I've been hurt before. Not like this. [ Music playing ]\u266a\u266a [ Door creaks ] [ Door creaks ] Scott? Are you in here? [ Door creaks ] Lydia, I'm sorry, okay? Look, I didn't mean that you're trying to kill people, okay? I just... I just meant that maybe... maybe you're somehow involved in getting people to kill themselves, you know? Which now that I say that out loud, it just sounds really terrible, so I'm just going to stop talking. [ Baby crying ] Stiles...- Do you hear that?- What?- [ Baby continues crying ]- Stop. Please, just stop. What do you want? I don't know what you want. Lydia, what do you hear? A baby crying.- Quiet!- [ Water running ] I hear... I hear water running.- It's time to sleep.- Oh, my God. Off you go to sleep now. She's drowning the baby! [ Suspenseful music ]\u266a\u266a Someone's drowning! [ Dramatic music ]\u266a\u266a He blocked it. He blocked the drain with something. I can't get to it. What do we do? Here, help me. [ Both grunting ] Is he dead? How long can a werewolf stay underwater? You think I know that? [ Both grunting ] Ow! [ Winces ] Wait a sec, the heater. Heater... Ethan came out of it when he touched the heater.- What?- It's heat, heat, fire. Heat does it, all right? We need something...- We need fire.- He's underwater. Yeah, I'm aware of that. Wait, wait. The bus. On the bus, they'll have emergency road flares. They have their own oxidizers. They can burn underwater.- Are you serious?- Yes, go! [ Grunting ] [ Dramatic music ]\u266a\u266a [ Suspenseful music ]\u266a\u266a [ Stifled sniffling and crying ] [ Gasps ] [ Gasps ] I got'em. What do I do? How do I do this? The cap, it's like a match. The cap's a match.- Stiles!- Yeah, I'm trying. Ooh. [ Growls ] Hey, Isaac. Got something here for you. I can't find Scott anywhere. It's happening to him too, isn't it? It has to be. Didn't you say there was another flare on the bus? Yeah. I'll get it. [ Flare burning ] Scott... Scott. [ Dramatic music ] [ Dramatic music ]\u266a\u266a There's no hope. What do you mean, Scott? There's always hope. Not for me. Not for Derek. Derek wasn't your fault. You know Derek wasn't your fault. Every time I try to fight back, it just gets worse. People keep getting hurt.- People keep getting killed.- Scott, listen to me, okay? This isn't you, all right? This is someone inside your head telling you to do this.- Okay? Now...- What if it isn't? What if it is just me? What if doing this is actually the best thing that I could do for everyone else? [ Crying ] It all started that night, the night I got bitten. You remember the way it was before that? You and me, we were... we were... we were nothing. We weren't popular. We weren't good at lacrosse. We weren't important. We were no one. Maybe I should just be no one again. No one at all. Scott, just listen to me, okay? You're not no one. Okay? You're someone, you're... Scott, you're my best friend. Okay? And I need you. Scott, you're my brother. All right, so... so if you're gonna do this, then... I think you're just gonna have to take me with you.- All right?- [ Sobbing ] No! I don't want to know. I really don't want to know, but in case you missed the announcement, the meet's cancelled, so we're heading home. Pack it in. Pack it in! I don't know what happened last night, but I'm pretty sure you saved my life. Actually, I saved your life, but not that it matters that much. It's just... it's minor detail. So I'm gonna give you something. We're pretty sure Derek's still alive. But he killed one of ours. That means one of two things can happen. Either he joins our pack... and kills his own. Or Kali goes after him, and we kill him. That's the way it works. You know, your little code of ethics there is sort of barbaric, just F. Y. I.- Hey, Ethan, I wanted to...- Coach, can I see your whistle for a second? What's that? Hey, Eth... I'm gonna need that back. Ethan... [ Blows ] Wolfsbane. So every time the coach blew the whistle on the bus, Scott, Isaac, Boyd... and Ethan. We all inhaled it. You were all poisoned by it. So that's how the Darach got in their heads. That's how he did it. [ Music playing ] Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stilinski!\u266a\u266a Twice in a month. Should I be flattered? In 1977, my Uncle Alexander Argent checked into the Glen Capri motel for a one- night stay. In room 217, he used a shotgun to blow out the back of his skull. The autopsy report noted an unusual animal bite in his side. If you already have all the information, what do you want from me? I want to know the Alpha that bit him. I want his name.

{"title": "That Winter, the Wind Blows", "content": "Taxi! Taxi! We decided to take down the Gentleman. That deal with Oh Soo is already over. At that time, Oh Soo said to go without you. What do you think? No matter how I think about it, I can't trust Oh Soo without you. You seem to have a brain. Hyung can't play without me. Okay. Let's do it then. But, don't let Oh Soo find out. Take a look. Who gave you a ride all the way here? Why are you not in a good mood? Feels good! Oh Soo left without the money. I told him to take it, but he said he only needs one pack of checks, so he took just that and left. Why in the world did he come here? Oh Soo must have really liked you. I don't want to hear it. But, we should plant more flowers here. It's the time to plant flowers, right? What should we plant? Something with a good fragrance... No. Just leave it. Why? After I get surgery, I will do it. Then, I will water them. They are wilting. By the way, the day I go to the hospital, I'm thinking of pushing it back a day. They said that I shouldn't show any signs of a cold, and my body isn't feeling well. It doesn't seem you have a fever. Don't worry. Doctor Cho prescribed me some medicine. Young, by chance, are you thinking of not getting the surgery? Why would I do that? You said I could trust Doctor Cho. And if I happened to refuse, you wouldn't tolerate that. Even if you had to knock me out, you would take me to the hospital. Wouldn't you? At least you know. I'll make you get surgery. I see hope. Oh. You said you were going to Gim Cheon tomorrow, right? I don't think I'll take the job. I'll just be by your side. You said it had to do with an unfair murder case. You should go. I'm not going. Cham. I guess this is my life. I can't do anything on my own, so you can't even save a person who was falsely charged with murder. You. Why didn't you take the money from Young? Are you risking your life to look cool? The effort I put in to save your life, do you know it or not? I know. The guy who says he knows, acts like this? The guy who says he knows, doesn't accept the money that Young decided to give and leaves empty handed? And then risks his life and goes back to con gambling? You think you're turning over a new leaf? By involving Young in all of your gangster activites, and then not accepting the money she was willing to give, do you think a rag becomes a towel? Hey. If you're a dirty rag, act like one. If you're a thug, live like a thug! Don't confuse people. Yeah... If I'm a thug, I should act like a thug until the very end. Why did I have to fall in love? Why did I have to fall in love? Right? Hee Sun. When I left that house, I left with dignity. Because I love her. Because she loves me too. In order to see me someday, that girl will live. That's why, right now we are apart. At least one time, even by chance, we will meet. Believing that, I was able to leave that house not only with dignity, but with arrogance. Without even saying that I'm sorry. But, Young saw that kind of me, and told me that she loved me. Did you like it? How do you think Young felt when she said that? She said that she was happy, but she looked lonely. Crazy guy. Bastard. You should have just scammed her. I shouldn't have made her fall in love? Crazy guy. I should have just scammed her. I shouldn't have made her fall in love with a guy like me. If you gamble too, and something happens to you, That will never happen. If Moo Chul doesn't play, then there's no one that can beat me and Hyung in the game or fighting. This is really the last time you're doing this. After this is over, let's go to the countryside. Save Oh Soo. Don't say a word to Hyung. Are you in the middle of your morning kiss? Just act like you don't see us! Oh, and I was trying to get us a game room, but I couldn't. There's no more discussion with me and President Kim. Stay out of it. I got it. You really got it? You said Moo Chul is out of it now, so I feel secure. I'm trusting you. I told you to trust me. I said it's delicious, first try it. Good morning. Oh! Good morning. Youngie, you came down. But, why are you all gathered here so early in the morning? Oh, I told Jung Hyun that I really can't eat Ajhumma's food, so she prepared this. She even went to the morning market. Wow. It smells so good. Young, when you go to the hospital, you won't be able to eat delicious food. Eat a lot today. Thanks to you, it seems I'll be indulging in some good food, too. Here, here. Let's all take our seats. From your 9: 00 to your 3: 00, Lotus root pancake, fried tofu, spiced sea weed, pickled radish, spiced clam. And the crab stew is for Jang Ahjussi. For yours, I took out all the meat part. Taste it. It's delicious. See! I told you that she would like it. After breakfast, Ahjussi, you should go to Gim Cheon. The false murder case in which he's a lawyer for, he said he's not going to do it because of me. We can't let that happen. Young. Instead, you can choose one of these three people to watch over me. Oh! I'll do it. I'll do it. Me. You heard it, right? Yes, do that. It's not another job. Someone's life is on the line. Okay. Then, since you're going to the hospital tomorrow afternoon, I'll make sure to come before then. A person's life has just been saved. Here. Let's eat. By chance, did Young call you? No. Lawyer Jang did. He said it might be pre- surgery jitters. They said she would surely come tomorrow. Noona. If Young get's the surgery, her eyes will- Let's not talk about the surgery. And the brain tumor- Don't ask. I'll come again. Hey, Soo. You... Do you know about Moo Chul's condition? It's nothing. Go. Hello. Hyung asked for some pain relievers. Oh, and Hyung wants you to give his regards to your parents. Crazy guy. Tell him to do it. Does he think I am his personal servant? Hey President Oh. Why aren't you answering your phone? Give me a call. Young, it's me, Oh Soo. Is it okay if I contact you sometimes? Not often, but once in a while. When I get curious about how you're doing. I'm blind. Because I can't get the audio info, is there someone nearby? Which number are you taking? 7611. I'll let you know when it comes. Thank you. Oh, it's here. Thank you. Ah, hurry up and get on. I'm sorry. The next stop time is getting late. I'm sorry. Get on. Thank you. Where are we going? Are we going to eat something good? I'm going to eat the whole pizza, I'll show you. Do Hoon, stop playing around. If you guys don't follow directions, you won't get pizza. Do you want to eat pizza at the center, or do you want to get in a line? Will you guys not get in a line? You'll be in trouble! Get in a line! We will get in a line. Hey kids, listen to instructions, listen. It's been a while since we're getting fresh air. We're in a line! We're in a line. Let's go. Was I being too stubborn? Should we have just eaten inside? The kids love it. You hear them, right? Yeah. Jung Min! Oh, it's you, Mi Ra. Are you going somewhere? Jung Min Noona? We're going to eat pizza. I want to join. I want to eat, too. Okay, let's all go together. How exciting! Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go. Hey, hey. Take a step to your left and walk, so we don't run into anyone. Okay. Ahjussi, sorry! Please stop the car! I have an emergency. I'm sorry, Ahjussi. Ahjussi! That car is veering into Kyung Gi direction, what should I do? Keep going? Pull up ahead of the car and pull over at the intersection. Okay. It's for real. Mi Ra, what's wrong? Ahjussi, how long did that taxi follow us? Taxi? I don't know. What's wrong? It\u2019 s nothing. What's going on? Well... I saw Oh Soo oppa. He was in a taxi and passed our car. It seemed like he was looking at you. I wasn't sure but it's true. Really? How did his face look? Is it okay? I don't know. He didn't look really good. Who are you? Who are you to come to me? Soo said his deal with you was done. Soo said that? Our dealing for the past 15 years, It's over on his terms? You think you suffered the most in this world? More than me, who's sister died. My parents who lost their daughter. You are the most pitiful, huh? That's really funny. All you lost was a one sided love. But you act like the unluckiest guy in the world. No matter how much I try, I just can't understand you, really! That is why I am going to try to understand myself. What? You and the whole world can't understand me. I will understand myself. In this world, I won't be the only guy who loved a woman, who died. In this world, a guy who has been rejected, a guy who's life was messed up because of his poor family. If you look in this world, there are a lot. This stuff didn't just happen to me. Are you maturing? Hee Sun, I too am living. At the age of 16, my mom, dad, and younger siblings... Eight lives were in my hands. Your older sister who's smile was pretty. She cried and died in front of me. It was hard to accept my reality as alright. If I were to be born again, I wouldn't live like this. But, I can't help the fact that this is the end for me. Hee Sun. Even if everybody in the world curses at me, the way I lived like this, I want to understand that it was because I was dumb and simple. Because if I didn\u2019 t even understand myself, I would be too pitiful. Smells nice. So this is what flowers smell like. Hey, are you sick? Your face is strange. Go to the hospital. You don\u2019 t look well. Hyung- nim Let's go to the hospital. Don't forget what I asked you. Oh Soo doesn't know your intentions. Hee Sun and Jin Sung, they all don't know. If you weren't going around, all this time, taking care of them. Oh Soo and Jin Sung would have already died by Kim\u2019 s hands. That you protected them like this... Go and organize the house. Unless you budge a little, we're not going to play games with you. President Kim obviously fraud gambles. But that much money? Okay. Let's do it like that. President Kim is the house, the dealer is you, and the cards, you guys bring it so no one can mess with it. Let's switch the House too. To here. We can't do that. I have to win you guys' money too but my goal is to step on President Kim. And if President Kim is out, the money you will win, will be small. Right? Okay. Call. Tell President Kim all the rules of the game. You guys will be deciding on it. If he says no, tell him to forget it. This is getting more interesting. Right. What's the matter, Young? Young! Young, is something wrong? You shouldn't say those things. The person who kicked you out of the house calls you in the middle of the night. You don't even curse, and with a concerned tone, If you ask me that, then what am I supposed to say? Why? You're having trouble sleeping? Are you scared about tomorrow's surgery? A little. What do you do by yourself, all day? Tell me. What do you do all day by yourself? Since you say that, I have nothing to say. I'm used to lying. What a pitiful life. I must have lived a long life, to see you joking around with me. Go to bed. After your surgery, call me like this again. Let's hang up. Okay. You were packing. Young, but the truth is, the work here- No, please give the phone to Mi Ra. What about the work? It's nothing. Give the phone to Mi Ra. Tell me. Mi Ra is busy packing for the hospital. Mi Ra, some water please. Okay. Ajusshi, hurry and come and make us some spicy crab stew. What is it, ajusshi? That is.. the work here isn't easy. It's complicated. I wasn't going to take the job and go back to Seoul. The suspect's mother cried all night, asking for help. Finish your work there. There's nothing to worry about. There's people who watch over me 24/ 7. Mi Ra, Jung Hyun unnie, Joong Tae oppa.- But still, if I'm there...- The surgery is tomorrow morning. Tonight they'll only do some exhausting examinations. If you keep this up, you may come into the operation room with me. Okay. I'll finish up my work here and come to the hospital at night. I don't want to. When ahjussi comes, I'll let him take over, then leave. You were only supposed to be here until 1 o'clock. But, ahjussi is coming at 4 o'clock. You said you were going to your job interview. Is my job an issue now? It's alright. Mi Ra, let me play the part of a friend, too. This is a gift for your interview. Are you really giving this to me? Not if you don't go to your interview. Hey... Make yourself look pretty with that, and go to your interview. I still have ahjumma. Stopping by at a beauty salon will take more time. Go already. Alright. Then I'll pack my bag. After ahjumma is done cleaning up, I'll tell her and go. Alright. Oh, Are Joong Tae's kids alright? They went to the hospital for gastroenteritis, but are alright now. Oppa and Unnie are coming to the hospital tomorrow, before your surgery. Okay. But, why did you bring out all those braille books? You only need a couple to read at the hospital. Since I already read it once before, I read fast now. I'm sorry. Something urgent came up. The surgery is tomorrow morning, and I'm done with the tests. My bags will be there in the afternoon. I'm sorry. I'll be there at 9 o'clock at night, for sure. Attorney Jang will be here at 4 o'clock, so stay closely with Young until then. I'm going then. Young, I'll do my best on the interview. Alright, fighting! Her admittance was at 4 o'clock, but it was changed to 9 o'clock. Who changed the time? I can't tell, nobody made a record of it. Dr, Cho and Dr. Goo are now... They are doing a surgery. Miss said to throw away all the braille books. Yes? They are braille books made by Secretary Wang, but after the surgery, she wouldn't need them, so. Oh... I got a call from Attorney Jang just now, he said he'll be here soon. Ahjumma, you can go to the hospital with the driver, take care of the room, and both of you can go on a vacation as planned. But, then you'll be here by yourself. Why, don't you think I can stay by myself for even 30 minutes? No, that's not what I meant. Go ahead, when ahjussi gets here, I'll go with him. I have something to talk to him about regarding the company. Go already! I got it. Please get through the surgery well, Miss. Then, we're leaving first. Hyung, call me later. Yes, Attorney Jang. Young, why? Hey, let me go with you. I'll be getting off in a minute. You'll ask for money again when you see Young. No, I'll be back. Then, when you see Young, tell her I said hi. Say hi to her? I'll be lucky if I don't get slapped. As hyung said, I will stay at the hospital, and go in the operating room. Come on... why... please answer the phone. Why... Taxi! The patient called herself and postponed it? Yes. You may leave. Young. Hi. Yeah. Hi. I couldn't answer your phone call, so I'm calling you back. I was also wondering how you're doing. You're fine, right? Yeah. But Young, where are you? Isn't today the day you're supposed to get hospitalized? You're right. I'm at the hospital right now. No. I'm at the hospital. You... where are you? You caught me. I'm at home. All of a sudden, I got scared of lying there for the surgery. The thought of lying on the cold surgery table alone was terrifying. But don't worry. Lawyer Jang is on his way right now. I'll go to the hospital soon. The bell's ringing. Lawyer Jang must be here. Lawyer Jang is on the line. He says he can't get a hold of Young. Hey. Young. Did you watch the video? No. Young. The video contains all the things I want to say to you. Young, go to the greenhouse. Go to the greenhouse, and- I have nothing more to hear from you. I told you. I understand you. Even though you don't have anything to hear, I have things to say. Young. Don't hang up. Listen to me. Young. Taxi. Taxi. Taxi. Taxi. I'm sorry, but can we talk about our business another time? Right now, Young is- I said, let's talk about our business another time! Another time! Young is in danger. If I don't go right now, Young will... Young will.. You two looked good together. The love you had. I always wondered if there was such a thing as love in this world. There's really such a thing called love. Just like the time when I first met you, I wanted to say a final farewell. I'll call you later. Later, let's talk about us. Young! Young! Young. Young. Young!

{"title": "Smash The Fallout", "content": "Hello? Excuse me. Hey. You're here. I work here. Right. I'm sorry to ambush you. I'm Karen, by the way. I left you a few messages, but you never called back. Girls just usually call to yell at me, so... Well, that's not what I was calling to do. I was hoping we could talk about your music. My what? You guys are writing a musical. I mean, I'd love to hear more. There's nothing to hear. I don't... I don't write anything. So the song you played last week after closing, that wasn't yours? Your friend just lied when he said it was from your musical?- Are you always like this?- Like what? Uptight. I mean, if you stopped clenching your jaw like that, you know, you could actually be cute.- I don't clench my jaw.- Relax.- That's really rude.- Okay, you're doing it again. You know, my... My shift's over at 5: 00, if you want to hang out. No, I don't... I don't want to hang out. I just want... You know what? Forget it. See ya. Dude, was that Karen Cartwright? No idea. She's the girl I told you about, the one that was here the other night. She's a big deal. She could help us. We do it on our own, all right? We don't need anyone's help. Move it. I'm late. Derek, it's me. I just wanted to let you know I finally got in touch with that composer.- Hey! Hey, Karen, wait up!- It turn... And... I got to call you back. Hey. Hey. Look, I'm sorry about whatever he said to you back there. That guy's your friend, right? Why, exactly? I know. He's complicated. But he's a really good guy when you get to know him and an amazing composer. He's just really protective of our stuff. Well, I wanted to hear more, play it for my friend Derek, see what he thought. Derek, as in Derek Wills? Like... like Derek Wills? He's... Irrelevant to this conversation, since your friend clearly isn't interested. Yes, he is. He just doesn't know it yet, and so am I. Look, can you meet me in a couple hours, when I'm done with my shift? There's something I want to show you. I realize your clients haven't gotten paid, Saul. No one has. I'm truly sorry. But mark my words, I'll have this all ironed out, Now, if you'll excuse me... The fact I was able to stage a single number in the middle of that circus you and Julia created is nothing short of a miracle.\" Circus\"... how choice. Let's talk about you juggling every Marilyn in the show. Boys, there's nothing to be gained by turning on each other. But it feels good. All right, then... Maybe we should turn on you. Did it not even seem a little bit strange to you that a Brooklyn bartender and his funny little friends had millions of dollars in cash lying around? I have spent the last three hours with the federal government and my accountant, going through every bill, receipt, and pay stub since the beginning of time. It's all in order. Did they say when we could get back to work? No, but we're still alive. Karen is singing tonight at the American theatre wing gala. Every Broadway bigwig will be there. So, for now, I'd like to ask both of you please not to accept any other project until all of this is settled. Yeah, I can't make that guarantee... I need to work. You have offers after last week's revelations? Yeah. Rebecca Duvall has moved on, so have the tabloids. So, beyond directing one of Broadway's biggest stars in- yes, I have several offers.- Amazing. What a business. Tom. Did you pack something warm for your trip to the moral high ground? Why don't you both get out of my office? I'll let you know what happens tonight. Julia and I are here for you, whatever you need. You are. This is the third meeting Julia's missed. She had a college thing with Leo. It's Miriam Abramson's office on line e... on the American theatre wing. I'm so jealous. You're going on tour with and I can't even get a callback for an eHarmony commercial. You got to bug your agent more. Are you kidding me? That's all I've been doing. But you are Ivy Lynn. She don't stay down for long. At least you're not Lisa McMann. Approaching, approaching. My God, my God, my God, my God... I cannot face that woman today. She's been plugging away longer than I have. Ivy? And Sam?- My God!- Lisa McMann! Hi! This is too funny! I was just thinking about you guys and that awful Shakespeare festival we did in the adirondacks. Don't remind me. So what have you been up to? Stationery! Yeah! I got out of the biz, and my whole life changed. Now I make my own hours. People actually want what I'm offering... No more rejection, rejection, rejection. Here is my guesthouse. Yeah. How about you guys? Hello, darling. How's my second favorite agent in the world? Very sweet. Loving the purple.- Thank you.- So... Got some news for me? What's happening with Well, Ronnie's a big fan, as you know, and she remains that way. She fought hard for you with the producers. Wait. Am I hearing a past tense in there? They're letting you go. Just because I shagged a couple of actresses? That's ludicrous. Well, it's not just because of that. The local news has a story. We got the heads- up an hour ago. Five dancers have come forward and are accusing you of sexual harassment. I have the names here somewhere. I don't want to talk to her assistant again. I want to talk to her. Looks nothing like you. I knew I should have moved offices. Jerry... I'm in a particularly tight spot, and you owe me.- I do?- Yes. You're giving me your table tonight for the American theatre wing gala. I thought you were already going. I thought I was too. But Miriam Abramson's assistant called to say that I am no longer on the guest list. Is that so? I have only a small window of opportunity for and I will not have it closed. I refuse to be treated like a criminal. So... You want to be my date? No. You're not going. It'll be just me and my creative team. I hear Julia's a mess. dropped Derek like a hot potato. Julia's fine. And so is Derek. My team couldn't be more unified. They'll sail through. You're welcome. Hello? Hi, boys. I need Julia too. Is she there? She's meeting with her realtor. What's going on, Eileen? I'm on my way home. Okay, we've got a slight change of plans. Karen's no longer singing tonight. Instead, it'll be the four of us, 8: 00 at the Plaza, and I want you on your best behavior, all of you... No fighting, no surprises, no scandals. Is that understood? Bloody paparazzo. Of course. And, Tom, tell Julia it's cocktail attire. Yep. No! No, I can't, not tonight. I'm not up for it, maybe tomorrow. You have to. Eileen needs us. Besides, it's been a week. You're starting to merge with the couch. Some air will be good for you. I got some air today. I met Leo in Riverside Park. And then you came home and put your pajamas back on? I may have met him in them. Julia! Look, it's... It's bad enough that I destroyed my family. Now Frank is telling people, and everyone is writing me. I have to relive the whole thing every time I check my email! I know it's hard, but we can't abandon in her hour of need. None of your relatives are gonna be at the thing tonight. No, just industry people... That's worse. They'll eat me alive. Look, if there was anywhere else that you wanted me to go with you tonight... The Bronx zoo, whole foods... The shower? I am asking my friend Tom to tell my partner Tom that I need the night off. Please? I will tell Eileen you're sick and represent the team myself. Thank you. You're the best. Yes, I am. And I promise, I'll get back up soon. Just a... Just a little longer? This is... this is what you wanted to show me? He doesn't write anything down, really, except, occasionally, when he's wasted. This one is particularly amazing. He doesn't know I saved it. Read the lyrics. I think they start on the cocktail menu. I don't understand... do you guys have a musical or not? We do. We're still working on it, but most of the songs are written. Does your friend even know you're here? Look... I just came from a clearasil audition and then found out the one thing I was looking forward to got canceled tonight, so you can understand I was hoping to get involved with something that's real. This obviously isn't it. Let me know if it ever comes together, okay? Find someone to play this for you. And if you like it or you want to hear more, come to our place tonight... We're having some people over. Maybe if you stop by and got to know Jimmy a little better, he'd let his guard down, play you some stuff. Think about it? You can just... Leave it at the door, whatever it is! Thank you! Julia? It's Ivy. Hello, Daisy. Can I have a word?- I can't talk to you, Derek.- Yeah, you can. We need to have a little chat about your understanding of the phrase\" sexual harassment.\" You know I never touched you. I didn't say you did. You only hit on me through four callbacks of and when I finally said I wouldn't sleep with you, I mysteriously lost out on the job. Well, as I recall, you didn't get the job' cause, while you were a pretty good dancer, you were only an okay actress, which is why, after all these years, you're still teaching pilates. You're unbelievable. Is that really what you came here to say? Yeah, pretty much. Since when is it harassment to ask someone out on a date? You don't get it. You're a big- shot director. You're in a position of power from the minute you wake up in the morning, and you don't treat that power with respect. Or did you really think women say yes because they actually like you? I'm sorry. I thought I was gonna be venting to Tom. Are you sure this is okay? Of course, I'm thrilled to be of use to anyone. I know you guys are super successful now. But did you ever feel like giving up? I could barely get up to answer the door. I just don't know what to do. Now I'm going in for parts that I would have passed on two years ago. Maybe I should just quit. I've been where you are. It's a brutal business. But just when I'd want to throw in the towel, something would happen to remind me of why I love it in the first place. And thus, the dysfunctional cycle continues. Yeah.- It cures everything.- It really does. I see... Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom! Listen, I've been meaning to call you. Honey, I've been so worried. You are... why? If they said half the stuff about a show of mine they're saying about yours, I would be on suicide watch. Well, you know our business. So much is exaggerated or just plain made up. Hey, you think I believe half of it? But I mean, come on, it's absurd. I mean, even Derek couldn't be as much of a dog as they're saying. You know, that's the kind of thing that... And Eileen rand running around with a drug lord?- Well, honestly...- Wait. I really don't know the specifics. Please do not thank me, but I have ordered everyone to stop talking about Julia having a nervous breakdown. Well, thank you anyway for that. But she's doing fine. The split was amicable. Well, you mean it's true? You know what? You have nothing to worry about. You are too good... someone's gonna snatch you right up. In fact, I have this idea that... What? No, no, no, no, no. J- Julia and I haven't broken up. I was talking about... No, we're fine. Harvey, look at me. Julia's fine. We are still together. So I guess I will see you both tonight at that theatre wingding thing? Yes? The two of you, together? Yes, you will. Julia will not only be there with me, but... We're giving a speech... A tribute, as a team... Both of us, together. And I will be right there cheering you on, as always. All right, later. Bye. Bye. So it's up to six dancers now? Well, thank you for telling me that, Peggy. Clearly, you're taking no delight whatsoever- in my misfortune.- Derek on two. Bye, Peggy. Did you not hear a word I said to you this morning? I didn't do anything. You did a lot. It's just catching up with you now. Yeah, whatever. What time is this thing again tonight? You're not coming. needs ambassadors, not another liability. I'm sorry. Well, Julia the adulteress is now Ambassador, but the serial seducer isn't? Is this a gender thing? You know what? I'm hanging up now, Derek. You're not going to' cause I'm gonna hang up first! Another one of these. I have a question for you, young mate. If you have something somebody wants, does that mean you can't sleep with them? Dude, I don't know. My shift's over. Dan, he's all yours. Come on. All women like me. Hello. You're not a dancer, by any chance, are you? Back off, dude. She's with me. I think the lady can speak for herself. Honey, I'm home. Listen... I may have done something. I know.- I heard.- You heard? Mary Testa just called. She said that she heard from Jackie Hoffman, who heard from Cheyenne Jackson, who heard from Harvey fierstein that we're presenting tonight?- Yes. Well...- You could have told me. That's important! I only said no because I didn't want to sit at a table and be silently judged all night. I can't say no to the entire American theatre wing. How did this happen? Okay. First of all, you can stand. Good to know. Tell me! Well, I got a call out of the blue... From the head of the theatre wing... I forget her name. Miriam Abramson. I've met her. Right, of course you have. Well, apparently Miriam needed someone to speak about the theatre wing and all the beatific stuff it does, and when they heard we were coming, they thought, who better than us? That is so nice... The community supporting us after everything we've just been through. What do you want to say? Do you want me to just take a stab at it? I've already jotted down a few thoughts.- A few?- My God. My God! I've got to do my hair. Here, you take over you're actually excited about this. Excited? No. But I can do this. You're my partner, and I'm not gonna let you stand up there alone. And try and keep it brief. I hate it when presenters run on. Giving notes already before I've even started... Julia's back! Or something like that. He's crazy good.- Like Jonathan Larson good- Yes. Maybe they're writing the next I know. It's amazing. I'm not crazy for stalking this guy, right? Honey, I'm ready to stalk him. Is he straight? He can't be straight. I mean, it's musical theater. It doesn't matter if he is or he isn't. He's not interested in me... He called me\" uptight.\" Okay, I say this with love, but you did sound a little uptight just now. You guys, just give her a break. She's just out of a three- year relationship, and she's a little bit rusty. She doesn't realize when a guy is hitting on her. You guys are missing the point. All I want to do is hear the rest of his songs. I just have to figure out how. I can think of one way. I knew you were gonna say that. Okay, you're definitely not writing the next Please. No, she isn't. But she just gave me a better idea. Thanks for checking in. Yeah, well, don't go pulling a Lisa McMann on me while I'm on tour, okay? Well, maybe she's got the right idea. She gave it her all, and when it didn't pan out, she exited stage left, and now she's the happiest person we know. What would you do if you couldn't do this? See, you don't have an easy answer. I gotta call you back. Good evening. Hi, there. Sorry to intrude. Miriam, lovely to see you. I was really so touched that you thought of us for this honor, especially in light of recent events.- I'm sorry. What?- God. I was just wondering if you knew when in the program that we'd be speaking. I get a little stage fright sometimes. But if I know when it's coming, then...- I don't... I- I'm sorry...- Okay, pardon me, hi, hi. Someone asked you to speak tonight? You did. You asked Tom... Levitt? No, I'm quite certain I didn't and wouldn't either. Hi. Hi. Hi. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. No, I'm sorry. And you're gonna be. Miriam. Excuse me. Julia. Julia? Can you please stay, so we can talk about this? I had a million reasons to be embarrassed before I came here tonight, and you just created a new one. I got caught in a moment, and it got away from me. I was gonna tell you the truth. But when you heard about this, you were so happy, for the first time in weeks. It got you off the couch. That doesn't make it okay! Excuse me. I have to tell you, I just saw- Wonderful.- I'm so glad. The new Fella's not so good.- Great.- Helpful. Julia... Look... I'm really worried about you. I feel awful about everything that you're going through with Frank and Leo, but it is very hard to watch you be this down for so long. Well, I'm sorry. Maybe you'd bounce back faster, but we're different people, and I need to do this on my own time. But it's not just your time. It's mine too. As partners, if you're down for the count, then so am I. Is that what this is about? I'm holding you down? No. You're doing it again. You're hiding something. Talk to me. I'm not made of glass. Fine. Word on the street is that you couldn't hack it on that you had a nervous breakdown, and that I should be looking for another writing partner before my career goes down with yours. You keep promising you'll come out of it, but then you find another reason to crawl back onto the couch. I am running out of excuses for you. I don't want a new writing partner, okay? I just want my old one back. So this is greenpoint. Half pierogies and half poseurs... What's not to love? So where is this guy? I'm looking. I'm looking. I'm gonna get me some moonshine... Or that.- That's Kyle. Don't you dare.- Too late. There he is, in the red flannel. Okay, I'll admit that's worth getting on the\" G\" train for. What are you waiting for? Go say hi.- Okay.- Go. Don't be uptight! Hey. Nice place. Thanks. Nice shoe. It's sticky. Kyle said he invited you. I said you didn't know where Brooklyn was. I hate to rock your world. I used to live in Brooklyn. You are rocking my world. My first apartment was in Fort Greene, FYl. Did it ever occur to you I might be a little cooler than you think? Well, you just said\" FYl,\" so, no. So what does a girl got to do to get a drink around here? Ky, we need some more brew! That. You can have mine for now. Thanks. Okay, what is going on with you? God, haven't you heard? Well, picture a whole line of rockettes... A big pile of girls, all telling lies about me. You know what I'm like. I'm not that bad. Come on! Look... I know it was a big mess at the end, and... I was a complete ass, all right? But I'm not a monster, am I? Why do you care what I think all of a sudden? Shouldn't you be asking Karen? Isn't she your muse? Maybe. Whatever. You're my friend. All right, you were my friend. I was a lot of things, Derek. But now I don't know what I am anymore. Or if I even want to stay in this business. You're far too good to pack it in... don't be so stupid. I couldn't have been that good. I wasn't Marilyn. You were my Marilyn. What do I know? I made a million stupid mistakes. Just prove me wrong. You are a singular talent. Don't give up. I don't think you're a monster. Nope, not gonna happen. Right. Miriam... How great to see you. What a night. Everybody's here. Eileen, I was told you wouldn't be joining us this evening. Well, you were told wrong. I wouldn't dream of missing this. After all, what's more important to me than our community? I would think, at this moment, your legal troubles. Miriam, you and I have a long history together. Surely you know I'm a woman of integrity. I have an organization to protect. In these economic times, we can't afford even a whiff of impropriety. So I trust you'll understand why I have to ask you and your team to leave. I should have known they were here with you. I'm so sorry no one in New York will get to see what you lost everything for. Best wishes to you. Yes. Yeah, yeah, I liked the strokes too, when I was 15. You know what you are? A snob. Me?- Yeah.- I'm a snob? Uhhuh. At least I'm not uptight. No, no, don't change the subject. You heard me, snob. Deal with it. So is that the piano you don't play? Yeah, I play a little... Whatever... When I'm in the mood. Well, I sing a little when I'm in the mood. I'll bet you do. So how will I know if you're in the mood. Well... It'll be very obvious. I might, like, look around and... Figure out what the vibe is. Okay. And then I might just... Stand up... And stretch... Warm up a bit. I think I get the picture. And then I... I might just finish my drink. Oops, already did... Kind of. Oop. And, probably just... Sing a song. You son of a bitch. Hold up a second!- You stole my songs?- What? No.- I should kick your ass.- Would you calm down? I just showed her one... I had no idea she was gonna do that. I.. I'm so sorry. I didn't think you'd get so mad. Stay out of this, princess. My God. I- I just think you're really talented. I want to help. I don't need your help, all right? I- I write for myself. You want to go write your own musical? Great. Go ahead. Leave mine alone. It's not just yours! Yeah, says the guy who sits there and watches me write the songs. Hey... your music is really good. I know it's scary to put yourself out there, but you have to... otherwise, you're never gonna know how good you are. Yeah. Well, unlike you, I don't need other people to tell me I'm good. I know I'm good.- I know I'm good too.- Yeah? Then why aren't you out there onstage, in the city, taking your curtain call, instead of out here, begging two strangers for a song to help you get there! You know, I think you should just take your friends and go. Don't worry. We're going. Well, we came, we saw, we got shunned. I say we go. We're going... But not until we do something very important. What's going on? I want to help. Good. I want the world to see what it would miss if went away. And how do we do that? We put on a performance they'll never forget. I like it. Calling Karen? On it. Straight to voice mail. What do we do now? Hi. Sorry. I came as fast as I could. No, please, Ivy. We're just so grateful to you for doing this. Hey, I'm just excited someone still wants to hear me sing. I realize you didn't want me here, but here I am. Please. None of us are supposed to be here. Hello. Hi. I'm Julia Houston. Just wanted to make a little impromptu tribute to Miriam Abramson for pulling off this incredible night. Right? I am happy to introduce... Ivy Lynn... One of Broadway's future stars, who will be singing one of our songs from This season. Yeah. Now I'm ready to go. So you made an good impresion last night. More than you know. Turns out the U. S. attorney's wife was there. How about that? What a happy coincidence. Yes, and it seems that we're allowed to resume work on the show, just so long as it's not for profit or public consumption. But how can you resume work on the show if you don't have the money to pay anyone? How much do you need? I'll have my lawyer draw up a contract. I don't want to owe you anything but money. Wonderful. Dude... Yo! All right, cut the cold shoulder. Just spit it out. You know what I'm upset about. You cost us our one shot with a real Broadway actor with actual connections. Look, I'm sorry if I... Overreacted. That girl just bugs me. She's so full of herself, you know? Well, she's gone, so you got your way, as always. You know, I've been cleaning up your messes since we were kids. Without me, you wouldn't have a job or an apartment or any friends because you piss everyone off. And that girl was the one person who could have gotten us closer to everything I've ever wanted. Would it have killed you to do something for me for once? I made coffee this morning. And by the way, I don't just watch you write. I'm writing the book for this thing. Selfish prick. What's the occasion? These are apology muffins. They do look very guilty. Tom, I am so sorry for everything. Last night I got so excited about the show again, just hearing Ivy sing our song. I promise I will work from here to eternity to make it up to you... And to if we're lucky enough to get another chance. Than and I'm sorry I lied to you. It was dumb. So, in the spirit of honesty and as your friend and partner... Can I say something? Yes. It's time to retire the scarves. Yo. Hey. Sorry. At least someone had a good time last night. Hey. How did you find me? My God, where did you get that? I may have left that on their fridge last night. What?- What's up, Jimmy?- Come on.- Hey.- You need to get back inside. This is everything I've written so far. I didn't expect this. Yeah. The only reason I'm trusting you with this is because I owe it to Kyle. Thank you. I think this could be really big. I figured you might need a little extra caffeine this morning and a little extra grease. You're too kind. And I wanted to thank you for what you said last night. You really helped pull me out of my funk. What did I say? I'm teasing, darling... Anytime. This storm's gonna pass for you too. Right now you're just in the worst of it. And... I'm sorry. Is this a bad time? Do you have company or something? Actually, I do. We're just having a little work session.- Hey.- Hi. I'm sorry. I- I didn't mean to intrude. I heard you saved the day last night. I was on the subway when they called me. Yeah. It was fun. So I guess I'll see you guys around. Bye. Right, then... This kid's song better be good enough to get me out of bed with a stinking hangover. Let's see, shall we?- What was that about?- Nothing important. Sync and corrected by justmine for www. addic7ed.

I will leak to one of your liberal media papers that you have terminal cancer. Step down from the bench, Verna. I'm asking you nicely. I could give you my letter of resignation, or I could give you the name of the man who tried to kill the President. What's the charge? This man is being held under the Patriot Act.( Projector and camera shutter clicking) The American people deserve to know Sally Langston, caught the President's shooter. You haven't turned bashful on old Hollis. I told the Attorney General I want to announce it tonight, in prime time. So what's the holdup? They're still interrogating the suspect. Suspect. That boy's guilty as a chicken- feathered hound. Well, they insist the evidence is circumstantial, that we need a confession before we announce.( Pen clicks) Are y'all using enhanced interrogation techniques? Yes, repeatedly. He's not cracking. Maybe they need to the enhancements.( Squeaking)( Huck grunting) Aah!( Choking)( Muffled screaming) What is your name?! What is your name?!( Coughing) Who are you working with?! Aah! Aah!( Choking)( Grunts and exhales) He hasn't answered any of our questions yet. He will. They always do. Eventually, they always do. Uh, I'm just wondering about... It really looks like he can't take much more of the waterboard... the interrogating... and I'm wondering maybe if we want to do a little less\" interrogating\" and maybe start thinking about his civil rights. I'm a U. S. attorney, gentlemen. I represent the United States of America. The United States of America is in this room with you, so you need to watch how you treat the prisoner on American soil. I represent the ClA, the Department of Homeland Security, the Patriot Act, and all the men and women who ever fought and died for your right to stand in this room with your glasses and your briefcase and spout your crap.

You work for Hollis Doyle, right? I think I've seen you on the Hill. Oh, Hollis and my daddy go back a dog's age. When I left U. T. and told daddy I wanted to move to Washington, he said Hollis was just the man to call.( Projector and camera shutter clicking) You don't say. I went to see Hollis the other day. Do you know he keeps a second phone in his office? Locked it in his desk drawer the second he laid eyes on me. It was a cheap little burner like the drug dealers use. A phone?

Well, I was a tri delt, and she was a chi omega, so we were just never gonna work out as roommates, you know?( Chuckles) I do know.- You know what the best thing about my new roommate is?- Mm. She's out of town.( Laughs) You want to get out of here? Let's, uh, just talk some more. I really want to get to know you better. You know what? On second thought, uh, I actually don't want to get to know you better. Thanks for the memories.( Kisses) Enjoy your night. My sources in the White House tell me Hollis practically lives in the Oval now that Sally Langston's acting President. He has done nothing but benefit from Fitz's absence. Should we call the number? No, just hold on to it. We may need it later. You all know that ever since our first meeting, Hollis Doyle has been out for nothing but brute power. He has lied for it. He's cheated for it. He's killed for it.

Maybe you could say hello and possibly kiss me before you start grilling me for information? Hello. Come here.- What did you find out?- Nothing.- Edison.- Nothing. I found nothing, and I mean nothing. Not a whisper. ClA, NSA, FBl... No one anywhere is admitting that they have anyone in custody in connection with the attempted assassination of the President,- which means...- They definitely disappeared him. If you would give me the name of your client, maybe I could help you with the... No. I told you, no name. If I had a name, maybe I could get somewhere. Sound like I know what I'm talking about- when I'm out there fishing for answers.- I told you, if we're gonna be together, we need to have a Chinese wall. Olivia, I'm trying to help you. I know. And I appreciate it. Come here.( Doorbell rings)( Sighs) Saved by the bell. I have an official letter for Senator Edison Davis.- You're getting letters at my house now?- Yes. I'll need I. D. and thumbprint, sir.( Beeps)( Clicking)( Beep) Sign here.( Click) And here.( Click) And here.( Click) Thank you. What did you mean? What?\" Saved by the bell\"... What did you mean by that? You're avoiding me. I am not. We haven't had sex in a week. The President was shot. What does that have to do with our love life? Fine. You want to have sex? We can have sex. Let's go. I don't wanna have sex if you're gonna have an attitude. I don't have an attitude. This is a symptom of whatever the hell is going on with you,- just like you and your Chinese wall.- That is not... You didn't even tell me that President Grant was going to ask to be reinstated.- What?- I am President pro tem of the senate, remember? He's gotta send two letters... One to me and one to the speaker of the house. Ah. Chinese wall. Fitzgerald Grant sent you a letter asking to be reinstated to his full powers as President? He's awake and conscious and he sent you a letter? And you didn't know? This is confidential information.( Chuckles) Edison.- Where are you going?- Out. Olivia, no one can know about this. President Langston doesn't even know about this yet. You cannot tell anyone.- Move out of my way.- Liv... Fine.( Keys jangle)( Footsteps approach)( Panting) I can't believe you didn't call me the second he woke up. And don't you dare use Mellie as an excuse, because I've seen how fast you can text on the sly. My apologies. No apologies. He's awake.( Scanner beeping whirring)( Exhales deeply) Tom. Hal.( Monitor beeping steadily) Is he resting? In a matter of speaking. Fitz. Olivia. He still hasn't woken up.( Sighs) What did you do? Gentlemen, what have we got? A blockade in the East Sudan straits. The good news is that President Grant anticipated this move, and he put a plan in place to call an emergency session of the security council. The U. N.? Are we appeasers, gentlemen? No, ma'am. Then recommendations on how we demonstrate that to the east sudanese. Two clear options.( Beep) We target the blockade directly using carrier assets in the Gulf of Aden...( Beep) Or we strike the headquarters and military installations in and around the capital where kinyazi is based.( Beep) I propose a third option. We do both.( Door opens) Ma'am?( Lowered voice) We may have to hold off on military action.- Which of you forged his signature?- I did. And you didn't try to stop her? She called me after she submitted the letter. Because I knew he'd try to stop me, and I didn't want to be stopped.- It's not the worst move.- It is absolutely the worst. It's a federal crime. It's treason. Forging the President's signature on a letter of reinstatement when he's not even conscious is... Do you understand that we live in a democracy with laws and rules and civil discourse? This is not Nicaragua. You can't just dic...- What, steal the White House?- Yes, we can. Been done before. Will be done again. What are you talking about is so far outside the law. I can sign Fitz's signature in my sleep. I can do it perfectly. Been doing it since he was governor. But I did not sign this paper lightly. I did not sign this without using my head. I'm not some man reacting out of rage and then thinking later. I am a woman. So I thought about it and I made my decision. Someone shot Fitz three times, someone shot Hal, they Britta Kagen, and Hollis orchestrated it. And now he's sitting pretty in the White House at the right hand of her majesty Sally Langston, whispering his dirt into her ears. That is not okay. And because we let that snake Hollis play in our garden for so long, we can't turn him in to the feds or turn him over to the cops or to the courts and wait for justice to be served, because we have to protect Fitz. We have to protect secrets. We all got in bed with the devil together and nobody wants to go to federal prison, so I wrote a letter and I signed it. I broke the law, I broke the Constitution, and I would do it again. The only way to get rid of Hollis without committing suicide is to get Sally out of there, whatever it takes. What are the doctors saying? The bullet in his head didn't cross the hemisphere. I know what his injuries are. What's the prognosis? That he could wake up in the next 72 hours and be fine. Good. And if he doesn't... Woodrow Wilson's wife ran the country for two years after his stroke, and no one was the wiser.- I could run it until he's ready to take the reins.- Cyrus. could run the country together. Liv? I'm thinking. Yes, Tom? I have the sat phone up. It's President Langston. She would like to speak with President Grant.( Chair scrapes floor) Thank you.( Door closes, phone beeps) Sally, it's like a miracle. All our prayers, the prayers you so ably led the American people in... They've been answered. I can't thank you enough. The lord is good to all. So, Mellie, I was hoping to schedule a visit. A visit? Yes, to offer your husband my personal congratulations. Or we can chat on the phone if he'd like. Is he awake right now? He's sleeping. Ah.( Mouths words) I'm sorry, Sally. The doctor's asking for me. I will pass along your congratulations and best wishes. Thank you so much for calling. Bye.( Phone beeps) She knows.( Projector and camera shutter clicking)( Door opens) David.- Pat.- Just wanted to see how things were going. I can't tell you, because telling you would be a violation of the Patriot Act, and I could end up in the basement of the Pentagon being beaten and waterboarded to within an inch of my life. Not that that ever happens. Yeah. This is the hard part.- The hard part?- Being a U. S. attorney. Keeping the balance between upholding the law and making sure Americans are safe. It's a fine line. But I put you in there because I thought you'd be the person that could walk it. We're shredding constitutional amendments like confetti. No. We're trying to figure out if some disaffected lunatic shot the President of the United States. Look, no one wants to see you succeed more than I do, but you can't just talk about wearing the white hat. You can't just fight the good fight. We live in the real world. Remember that.( Cell phone ringing)( Beep, door closes) I haven't found out anything else.( James) Nothing? No. Not about Olivia. Not about any of them. What's the problem? You've had a week.- I've been busy.- Too busy for the story of the century? The President was shot. There's a lot of stories of the century this week. I'm not giving up on election rigging. Don't worry. I'll get to it.( Beep)- She thinks this is Becky's number.- I don't know.- Should we call it?- She said not to call it. But it could lead us to Becky. It could help Huck. If Hollis was calling Becky, that means he was behind the shooting, and then tried to frame Huck for it. So why aren't we going to the police? Why aren't- we getting Huck out of jail?- Huck's not in jail. They took him under the Patriot Act. That's not jail. That's... that's the dark side. But still, why aren't we going to the authorities? Why aren't we trying? Why are we just sitting here? We're not just sitting here. Liv has a plan. What plan? We're out of our depth. Liv runs with the big dogs. And, you know,- I'm starting to think...- What?( Sighs) Liv worked for the White House. The President was shot. Huck is in jail for doing it. One of the richest men in the country... Hollis Doyle... might be behind it. This is next- level stuff. Grassy knoll stuff. There's a whole other layer of D. C., you know, where real politics happen, where decisions are made... Not about democracy or the flag... about power. This is about things that go bump in the night, stuff regular Americans never hear about. This is the real deal. We don't question Liv on this. Everyone. We have a new client.( Projector and camera shutter clicking)( Clicking) Do they take me for a fool? For an absolute child? What did the First Lady say when you called? Oh, I was treated to some sort of... I don't even know what... A performance, amateur theatrics. You thinking what I'm thinking?( Sighs) They could have a stone- cold corpse over there, and they'd all be swearing he's alive and well and fixing to run a half- marathon. Well, I have a duty to the American people. A solemn, sworn duty, by God, you do. But if I challenge this reinstatement letter, I risk seeming like a power- grabbing opportunist. In a game of Texas hold'em... And that's all life ever really is... You never want to tip your hand. So you get someone else to do your bidding. If I leak that letter to the press, then they'll ask the questions I can't ask myself. And you swoop in at the end and rake up all the chips. I have in my hands, a copy of the letter of reinstatement President Grant signed just hours ago. Cable and nets are wall- to- wall with it.- Someone leaked the letter.- Wonder who. They're gonna want to see the President. And by\" they,\" he means everyone on planet Earth. Harrison, find a friendly doctor. Make them a hero. You want me to lie to the world? Lie? Hell, no. That would be in conflict with both of our ethical standards. We took oaths, right? Would you say that the President's recovery has been miraculous thus far? Given the injuries, it's certainly impressive. So just short of miraculous? Quinn, go with him. We need an anecdote from a well- placed and unimpeachable inside source. I'm a terrible liar. I'm not your man, ma'am. No, it's not a lie. It's just a story. You've told a tall tale to a kid before, right, for fun? No, ma'am.( Man)\u266a My lady Cyrus, assure the power players... The Hill, the cabinet, senior White House staff. You need to live this lie. Act like Fitz' return is a foregone conclusion.( Projector and camera shutter clicking) Well, that depends on the timing... Cyrus. Excuse me. What are you... Don't mind me. Just grabbing a few briefing books. The President is ravenous for east Sudan intel. Oh, and take your time clearing out of here. The end of the day'll be just fine. As you were.\u266a The news is encouraging, but questions are swirling about the President's abilities to function, given the seriousness of the injuries. Focus on the positive. His improvements are miraculous, and his mobility shows signs of full recovery. His movements are involuntary. He's not even conscious.( Imitates buzzer) That's a negative. Movement at this stage... Involuntary or not... shows signs of full recovery, right? Right, but... No\" but\" s. Stay positive. You're a miracle worker, plain as day. Don't let anything get in the way of that. Hmm? Abby, call Kimberly Mitchell's producer. Leak that I just returned from the hospital, where I visited with the President. Pretend you're going behind my back. Are you sure you wanna lie to the press? I know what I'm doing. Just make the call.( Clears throat) Jeff, it's Abby Whelan. Look, you've got to give me something. Anything. Off the record, at least. He's in remarkable shape, but he's not gonna go public until the wound on his head is a little more healed, till the hair grows back. Is he worried about the perception with our allies?- Our enemies?- Oh. I said enough. What?( Sighs) This stays between us? Of course. The First Lady thinks he's a little vain.( Projector and camera shutter clicking) Mellie, move back into the residence. I'm going to set you up with one interview. It's the only one you'll do. Gesture and smiles only as you walk out that door.\u266a He is looking forward to speaking to the American people and thanking them for their devoted support. He might want to wait till the scars heal to do that. Am I right?( Chuckles) Well, you said it, not me, but yes. Between you and me, he's a little bit vain. Given the injuries, I'm a woman of science, so I don't use words like\" miracle,\" but in my 25 years, this is as close as I've come.( Projector and camera shutter clicking) So obviously, we'll continue to monitor his progress going forward. But I'm not funny. Let the words do the work. Trying to remain strong... You know, he told a joke just after he woke up. You wanna hear it? According to this White House source, soon after waking up, the President told the First Lady,\" Next birthday? Let's order takeout.\" And so it's just a matter of when doctors release the President. The dark cloud has lifted over the country, as the President is clearly out of the woods and ready to take office.( Monitor beeping steadily)( Projector and camera shutter clicking)( Water running, shuts off)( Toothbrush scrubs)( Sighs deeply)( Jangles and clatters) Why aren't you happy?- What?- You should be happy. You thought the President was dying. Now he's awake, which is a miracle.- Yes.- An actual miracle. A- call- the- Vatican miracle. I mean, with that kind of gunshot wound to the head, even in the best circumstances... Well, to be up and talking and ready to resume office so soon after that kind of traumatic brain injury... No delayed motor skills or aphasia...( Chuckles) Saints be praised. Miracle, right? Aphasia? That's a word you use in sentences now? It is. I quit my job because you said the baby would be here. The baby you say exists and is waiting for us but isn't here... I told you the baby has jaundice and a social worker is working to have the paternal rights severed. The baby isn't here, so I've got nothing to do all day but to research gunshot wounds to the head on the Internet and call a few of my expert sources at Johns Hopkins. The experts, by the way, agree with the Internet... miracle. Maybe we shouldn't pick up the baby at all,- I mean, if you're too busy.- Cyrus... I could call the social worker and let her know that you're not ready, what with your research on miracles- taking up so much of your time.- I want the baby.' Cause you just said you quit your job, but I noticed you haven't given up your White House hard pass. Also when I called the\" Times,\" they said you sill worked there. They know I'm planning on quitting, and I will, just as soon as we get the baby. Great. That's a relief. Because that little girl isn't going to raise herself, is she? No, she is not. Still, adoptions go wrong all the time. Right? Wouldn't get your hopes up.( Clatter) It might take a miracle to get a baby in your arms.( Door slams)( Grunting) Aah!( Coughs) Ohh!( Spits)( Panting) You can talk. You can not talk. It's up to you. But I gotta tell you something. If you don't, you're get the death penalty. You're gonna fry. And I'm betting that President Grant... he's gonna throw the switch on you himself.( Breathing heavily) What? You're gonna fry at the hands of President Grant.- Now... you talk to me...- I'll...- Maybe I can get you a life sentence...- I'll talk. I'll talk. I'll talk. Well, there we go. But not to you. To them. Everything you need to know. But you have to come out from behind the glass. Just come out, and I'll talk to you.( Breathing heavily)( Camera beeps) Is it on?( Beeps)( Panting) Start talking. Is the President still alive?( Man) You can start with your name. Is the President still alive? I'm asking the questions. I have one question first. Is he still alive?- You got one last chance.- Is he still alive?!- For crap's sake!- Yes, he's still alive. Then he's still in danger. She's not done. If he's alive, she's not done.- Shut it down.- She's coming back to finish the job.- Shut it down!- It's not over. It's not over. You hear me? It's not over. Turn off the camera.( Huck screaming) Turn off the camera. Right now! Turn off the damn camera!( Cell phone rings)( Ring)( Sighs deeply)( Ring)( Click)( Sets down phone)( Footsteps approach)( Door closes) I know where Huck is. They're torturing him. They skipped the sleep deprivation and electric shock elements of the program, went right to the free skate... waterboarding. They've been at it for three days, but he won't crack. They can waterboard him for three months. He won't crack because he didn't do it.- I don't know if he did it or not...- I'm telling you. And we know how good your word is. Look, the point is, it's a matter that needs to be decided in a court, not a torture chamber. He did tell them something.- What?- That the President's still in danger and whoever shot him will be back to finish the job.( Projector and camera shutter clicking) I need a meeting with Sally. Do you wanna come talk about Grant's actual condition? Because this whole he's- halfway- to- doing... push- ups- on the White- House- lawn bit is wearing awful thin. The man you're torturing in the Pentagon isn't the person who shot President Grant. But he knows who did, and he can help Sally find her. You mean your employee, who you were harboring in your office. We gave you a hell of a break on that one. Thank you. But the fact remains you have the wrong person in custody, and he will die at your hands rather than confess to a crime he didn't commit. And you and Sally can't get the media bump without the confession, so... Why on earth would I release him? On your say- so? Because this somehow feeds the charade that Fitzgerald Grant is awake? I wasn't elected yesterday, Olivia. I know political kabuki when I see it. President Grant's life is still in danger.- I know it's a leap of faith...- Leap of faith? It's swallowing tacks and expecting to puke up a unicorn. These are your experts, Sally. You called them, not me. So why don't we listen to what they have to say? Gentlemen. The prisoner was the star of the B- 613 program.- Which means?- That the United States government funneled millions of dollars into teaching him how to execute a target without getting caught. The prisoner's also one of the best trackers the agency has ever seen.- His dossier, ma'am.- And you are telling me that none of the literally thousands of intelligence agents I have at my disposal can do what this man can do? Read the summary on pages four and five, ma'am.( Pages rustle)( Papers rustle) How would we go about it?( Muffled screaming)( Buzzer sounds, door opens)( Door closes) Hello, gentlemen. Where the hell do you think you're going? Me? I'm not going anywhere. But you all might want to pack it in, because, fellas, you're back on American soil. By executive order, this man is to be released.- What?- President Sally Langston has ordered that you stop torturing this United States citizen and let him go immediately.( Huck panting)( Car departs) We don't have a lot of time.( Panting)( Projector and camera shutter clicking) What is this? A transfer form requesting the President be moved to camp David effective immediately.- I need you to sign his name.- Why are we moving him? You don't need to know we are transferring him.- You just need to sign.- Several reasons. It's safer, it's a lot easier to control the guest list, and the press has no access to the place. It takes him out of the Capitol. It makes him look weak. He's unconscious. He weak.( Sighs)( Pen clicks)( Scribbling continues) Thank you.( Door opens) How are you holding up? Me? I'm fine.( Sighs) It's not easy living a lie, pretending everything's perfect when it's not. I learned that lesson a while ago.( Sighs) I keep asking myself, what am I gonna do? I mean, I- I can keep the stories going for so long until... But if he never wakes... What am I gonna do? What are gonna do? Do you ever wonder that? What you're gonna do without him? Mellie, you need to pull it together. You have one job here... holding off Sally. I'm doing everything else, so get a grip. Okay? Fine.( Projector and camera shutter clicking) I'm not trying to be difficult, Senator. Exactly what is your role here anyway? I'm simply telling you the President- isn't accepting visitors.- On whose authority?- When Olivia gets here...- You can ask me yourself. Thank you, Harrison. I'll be down the hall if you need me.- Hello.- Haven't seen you in two days.- I've been working.- You haven't been home in two days.- I have been working.- You're not taking any of my calls.- Again...- Liv. Every third time you call, I answer. So you have a system for avoiding my calls? That's why you're here? Because I haven't been answering my phone to your satisfaction?- I'm here to see the President.- He's not accepting visitors.- You're a visitor.- I'm his... You're his what? I'm his friend. Yeah. You should go. I'm not leaving until I see him. You're not seeing him. Okay. You all may have done a masterful job with the press and the American public, but Sally Langston is whispering to anyone who will listen that all is not right here in Camelot. Sally has a right to her opinion, but I'm not gonna dignify it with a response. Olivia, if that letter from President Grant was forged, there will be joint congressional hearings and letters of impeachment. The chief justice of the supreme court will turn the senate chamber into a courtroom, and you will be the star witness for the prosecution. Forging that letter or helping whoever did forge that letter is staging a coup. It's an act of domestic terrorism. You have no idea what you're talking about. I am the leader of the senate. If my job description requires, I won't hesitate to prosecute you to the full extent of the law. And guess what. I make the law. So you talk it over with whomever you need to talk it over with and then you let me know when the President is ready to see me. Good- bye, Edison. They're moving Fitz to camp David. Their mamas didn't raise no fools. It's a smart play. Hide him away from media scrutiny, run out the clock. Something has got to be done. This uncertainty is bad for the country, bad for the markets, bad for our image around the world. We look weak to our adversaries, confused to our friends. Something's gotta be done. Hollis? Plausible deniability, Madam President. I'm handling it. Don't you worry a bit about it.( Door closes)( Cell phone rings)( Beep) Hey. Yeah, I'm watching it right now.( Projector and camera shutter clicking) I'll be ready.( Projector and camera shutter clicking)( Baby fussing) Wash your hands. Yeah, I was just... I- I don't need to be in here or get in the way. I only wanted to look at her through the glass, and... and she wasn't there. She's over here in the back, so you have to come in. It's great if you come in. She needs to be held. She needs to bond with you.( Fusses) You know what? I probably shouldn't. I mean, all the papers aren't signed, and I- I was just stopping by. You're gonna be her father, right? Come and meet your daughter. It's fine.( Cooing) Oh. Would you like to hold her? H- hi.( Fusses) She's clearly very intelligent. Yes, she is.( Whispers) Hi. Hi, cutie.( Baby voice) Hi.( Speaks indistinctly) That's right. That's a good smile. That's right. I'm gonna be your daddy. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Yes, I am.( Projector and camera shutter clicking)( Projector and camera shutter clicking) Map of the motorcade route, courtesy of the secret service. Thanks. You might also find this interesting.- What is this?- The number we pulled off Hollis Doyle's burner phone. If it's Becky's, we'll have our proof that Hollis is the one who hired her. Huck, is there any chance... No. Becky's a professional. If she gets a call from anyone but Hollis on this number, she'll spook. Liv? I won't let you down this time. Promise.( Monitor beeping steadily)( Clicking)( Projector and camera shutter clicking)( Rifle clicks)( Siren wailing in distance)( Cell phone rings)( Ring)( Beep)( Huck) Hi, Becky.( Huck's voice) Hi, Becky.( Scoffs) They're not moving him to camp David tonight, are they? No. And by the time I reach for my gun, you'll have put four bullets in me? Five. One for the dog.( Man) Drop the gun! Get on your knees! Show me your hands! Show me your hands! Let me see your hands!( Man) Down on your knees!( Men shouting indistinctly)( Man) Put the gun down!- It's Kate.- What?- My real name...( Man)- All right, move it in. It's Kate. Okay.( Grunts) What's your name? Does it matter?( Handcuffs click)( Man) All clear. Take'em down.( Man) Clear that weapon.( Man) In five... four... Three, two... My fellow Americans, for the past week, our nation's law enforcement agencies have been working tirelessly around the clock,( Knock on door) Was that a knock? Someone check on the door. Got it. We're releasing him to your custody. Thank you.( Handcuffs clicking)( Keys jangle) psalm( Door opens)( Door closes)-- Welcome home.( Projector and camera shutter clicking)( Knock on door)( Door opens) Madam First Lady, come right in. Acting President Langston, thank you for inviting me down. I see you've been redecorating. Oh, I just moved in some family photos and set aside that dusty old ship Fitz had on the desk. Oh, that dusty old ship was a gift from George Bush Sr., but whatever. It'll all be going back soon enough. Mm. Some light reading? It's the east Sudan briefing. There's only so much\" what to expect when you're expecting\" one can take, and the President likes me to stay up on things. Especially now, I'm sure. How do you mean? Well, as he recovers his full capabilities.( Laughs) Oh. The President is sharp as a tack. It really is quite remarkable. Unbelievable, one might say. Modern medicine. I've just done some fascinating reading myself. Mm? On graphology. It's... The study of handwriting. Yes. Much of it is rather dry and somewhat impenetrable, but other insights are fairly easy to digest. For example, the\" t\"- bar. I'm not familiar. Well, it's quite elegant in its simplicity, really. You see, when a right- handed person writes the letter\" t,\" they make the cross at the top go from left to right. But when a left- handed person makes the\" t\"- cross, it goes from right to left. Now the President is left- handed, but his First Lady is not.( Paper rustles) Fitzgerald Thomas Grant. Three\" t's\" in all, as it happens,( chuckles) There's an old saying... An expert is someone who's read one book. I'm quite sure I could find an actually accredited graphologist who will swear that Fitz signed that piece of paper, particularly given that he's still recovering his full motor skills resulting from a gunshot wound to the head. And will you also find a doctor? Because I have a sworn affidavit from one of President Grant's physicians at James Madison hospital saying that your husband has failed to so much as open his eyes. Madam First Lady, you will withdraw this letter of reinstatement, or I will have no choice but to reveal it for the humiliating forgery it is. Cyrus? There's no miracle. What? Fitz... He's not awake. He's not talking. He's not anything. There's no miracle. We lied. Report it. Don't report it. I don't care anymore. It doesn't matter. I just called my boss and quit. I'm not a reporter anymore. I'm not chief of staff anymore.( Sighs) Let's go get our baby. Let's.

But it doesn't work now. So she says there's a base camp where the producers are. She takes us to the base camp. It's where the producers have their tents, and where they basically see us in their monitors and everything. And when we got there, it was a disaster. There's just blood everywhere.

Well, you set something up and... so that we can communicate with the outside world. So you jam the signal? Yeah. You jam the signal. Very common during war, especially since World War Il. So the Allied Forces couldn't communicate. So you could attack and nobody would know you were coming. They don't want us to talk to anybody. They don't want us to have any support. Who the hell's doing this, is the real question. Like, why and who? You know, it's obviously-- Well,\" Why?\" is the biggest question. Why would they want to leave us here stranded? They're trying to cover up what happened. I think we're talking about two\" Theys.\" Are we talking about the production company's\" They\" or\" They\" who did whatever to the base camp?

I think what we need to do is we need to protect ourselves and prove that something happened here.- I like that.- We need proof of what happened to us.- Yeah.- That's the only protection that we have. I like that. That way, once we get the hell out of here, we can sue the shit out of them.- Sounds like a plan.- Get my money one way or the other, you know? So you guys keep filming. Do what you're gonna do. But we want a record of it. You can have copies or whatever, but we want a record of it. Do you understand? _ _ So we have an understanding? _ Good. Keep shooting. That's what we need.' Cause that's the only proof that we have. That's to protect us.- Sounds like they're real, guys.- Is that thing still on? It's still working, isn't it? What is it? Wow. It's a fucking gas mask. Why the fuck are they sending us a gas-- Why are you guys sending us a gas mask?- Plus-- plus, you guys...- You guys gonna gas us? I thought you guys didn't know what's going on. What the hell's going on? Why are people still sending us shit? We just went to the base camp and it's all fucked up. What's going on, guys?- Huh? Huh?- Stop. Stop it. What the fuck's going on?! These guys don't know nothing. Is the game still on? There's eight contestants left, not including the cameramen. One gas mask. Are they planning on gassing us, or... You fucking kidding me? I don't like getting fucking played. Hey, fuck you guys! Fuck you! They're fucking with us, man! Huh?! _ What's going on here?! Why are they fucking with us?! Johnny, don't break everything! We got a girl that's fucking dying! And they can't send help?! What the fuck? Get that fucking thing off me! Are you watching? Are you fucking watching?! Get us out of here!- What the fuck's in here?- You gotta relax. Let him do it. Damn.- The fuck is this thing?!- Back off. You're fucking crazy. Johnny, relax, man. Aah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! There we go.- Is it loose?- It moves a little. It moves a little. The back is exposed, and there's, like, a... a door.- Get your fingers...- Put your finger in. Come on. Don't pinch yourself.- Oh.- Pull it. Pull it that way.- Oh.- Wow. Sorry.- It's full of gears.- What is that? Like clock gears.- Clock gears?- It looks like a clock. There's a timer, too. Daniel looked at it, and he said that there was some kind of, uh, gears that operated on their own. This thing runs on its own.- How does it-- how does it run on its own?- What do you mean, it runs on its own? It's-- it's set up to go off at, like, specific intervals of time. It... There's nobody controlling this thing. There's nobody... watching us. There's-- there's no game. This thing runs on its own. It always has.- So no one's controlling this?- Nobody's controlling this thing. Here's something. Is it-- is it Russian, Sam? I think it's Russian. It's gotta be Russian. Sam?- Is it?- Yep.\" Behavior... Reward... Simulator\".\" Behavior Reward Simulator.\"\" Test Group C.\"\" Behavior Reward Simulator, Test Group C.- Test group C?- Test group C. I think that's us. I think we're Test Group C. Well, the radio doesn't work. What are we supposed to do? We go. We get the hell out of here.- Why would we stay--- Go? Go where? Don't-- don't they say that when you're in trouble, you just stay put wherever you are and wait till help comes? We were just talking about what we were gonna do, because apparently the help button doesn't even connect to anything. If we sit and wait, we're just gonna sit and wait and die. Either someone's gonna come and kill us or do something to us, or we're gonna die of starvation. Okay, I think we should wait and find a way to defend ourselves. That's just my last word. _ I know. Me, too. I don't like making promises... if I can't keep them, but I want to make a promise to you now that I'm gonna keep. I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you, okay? And I mean that. I'm really glad that you're here. Yeah, I'm really... glad I met you and that I'm-- I'm here, too, yeah. I mean, I wish the circumstances were a little different. I know that... you had no idea that the helicopter wasn't gonna come. We'd get Irene into the helicopter. She'd be brought to the hospital, and she was gonna be okay. And I... I believe that. What you did... is forgivable... if you ask. Irene's never gonna forgive me. But that's not for you to decide. Think about that. What we need is a way for people to find us. I mean, how are they gonna come looking for us if they don't know we're missing? Well, if she's serious about this jamming business, that means we're never gonna get a signal out. What about using a fire? What do you mean, using a fire? We have a fire. No, like... a big one. You know, like, think back to, like, history class when you were a kid. I- I remember learning about these. You can do a signal fire. And you can see'em for miles. Like, the Plains Indians did it all the time.- It's like a huge bonfire.- Make a signal fire. That-- that's not a bad idea, actually.- Well, I guess we could start--- Let's start with those. Let's start-- Yeah, and try and find some trees- that have already fallen, uh...- Right.-... so we don't have to cut'em down.- All right.- Wanna come with me, Sam?- Will do.- All right.- Let's go. Hey. Hey. How's she doing? Not good. Annie had a great idea that we should build a big signal fire and hopefully somebody will come help. Wanna come help us get wood? Um... okay, yeah. Miljan. What the hell you doing? I was just checking on Irene. She's got enough nurses. We're building a bon-- We're building a bonfire.- Come on. We need your help.- No worries, man.-\" No worries.\"- I'm ready to help.- Yeah, yeah. You're ready to help.- Always.- Daniel.- What?- Can you help me?- Of course. This weather's crazy. I mean, one minute it rains, one minute it's sunny. It's hot, it's cold. It's ridiculous. Sorry I busted you, by the way. You really watched that show? I loved that show. Thanks. Let's try to keep moving. It's getting cold. Stand still, you're gonna get real cold. Just keep moving. The hell is this? Guys, we're still gonna need some bigger logs once we get this thing started anyways, so...- Yeah.- We gotta keep just laying it on,- three times this amount.- Yeah. We have a ton more...- Hey, Miljan?- What? Since when do you speak Russian? I don't speak Russian. Yeah, but I got-- I found this book. And it's in Russian.- What are you doing?- Give me that freaking book! What are you doing? Come on?- Hey!- Stop! Stop! What are you doing? Hey! Stop, guys! Stop it! Hey! Get off of him!- Get off of him!- Sam, what are you doing, Sam? Come on, what are you doing? Miljan, what happened? Are you okay?- That's my fucking book!- Are you okay?- I am okay.- Yeah.- He stole my book!- This is what he's been doing all along- while everybody else is working!- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!- Stop it, Sam! Come on!- What? What book? What is this? It's my book. I found it.- Found it where?- Found it in the ground. In the box. It doesn't matter. It's my book.- Inside the ground where?- It belongs to me.- Yes, under the--- Where'd you find it? Doesn't matter. I want it back right now.- What does it say?- What is this, Russian?- Yep. Russian.- Where did you find that?- In the woods.- When?- Do you read Russian?- I don't read Russian.- Then why do you want it so bad?- Step away.- Why didn't you tell us, Miljan?- Why were you hiding it from us?- Let me see.- Do you know how to read this?- I'm not hiding it. I'm just reading it by myself. I don't even think that's Russian. What is that language? It's mine. It belongs to me. What does it say? It's handwritten. It's kind of hard to read. Um...\" Our guards were frightened by the sight of the abandoned... outpost, fearing what they call the... Valley...\"\" Feeling what--\"\" Fearing what they call the Valley Men.\"- Valley Men? What's that mean?- The Valley Men? Wh- what do you mean, Valley Men? What else does it say? I don't know. It doesn't say. It just-- it-- it-- it says that they wouldn't carry on, and then it just trails off. It's dated 1927, and it's signed by... someone called... Kulik. 1927? It's an old book. Book is over 80 years old. What do you mean,\" The Valley People\"? I mean, what's that?- I don't know.- Guys, who cares about this?- Fuck.- Let's just get back to making the fire.- It doesn't matter. I mean, the game's over. Who cares?- Let's go.- It's just a stupid book. I used to think that everything had a purpose, that there was someone somewhere with a master plan, and it would all someday make sense, but now I'm just-- I'm not so sure. Being in a situation like this, everything you believe or you thought you believed about people starts to break down, and you don't really know somebody until you see'em in a crisis, but I like to believe that people are basically good. Even when their life is on the line, I like to believe that. I to believe that. You had a lighter? You had a lighter this whole time? Yeah, I did. But now since the game's over, doesn't really matter, so... We get the fire lit. It's great. And then... What the hell are you doing?! What are you doing?!- What's the matter!?- Listen, guys, we don't know who is---... to collect this wood?!- Listen to me! We don't know what or who's out there in these woods. We have no idea. You light this fire, and everyone is gonna see it, everyone, friends or enemies. And whoever did that to the base camp-- they're probably right now looking for us. We can't take that chance! I think she's right. How are we gonna get a signal out of here? That's it. We're done. Oh, my God. It's getting worse. I think it's infected.- What happened?-- What-- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey. Listen. You're fine, you're fine, you're fine. Hey.- Calm down.- It's us. Annie and Daniel. I want you to sit down. You with me? You here? I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. It's fine, it's fine. I thought someone was attacking me. Nobody's attacking you, okay? You're fine. Where's the... Where's the helicopter? Is it coming? Did you guys reach them? Are they coming? Yeah, they're coming. They're-- they're-- they're coming. They're gonna be here... in... um, about a day or two, and... you're gonna be-- you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Daniel... you're not a very good liar. What are we gonna do? I don't know. Um... I don't think we can really leave and just go in one direction like originally planned. That seems kind of stupid and illogical right now. But at the same time, I definitely don't want to stay here and wait for someone to come find us and do what they did at that base camp. Guys, I'm just thinking about the-- the grim situation that we're facing right now, and I think, uh, whoever took the rifle should own up right now. I never found it. I didn't find it, either. I didn't even have the bullets. I did. Sneaky girl. You had the bullets?- Yes.- You took the bullets from my bed? Yes, I did. You see? You thought I had them the whole time. No, we're all sneaky. Well, we still have a missing rifle, and, uh, we're really gonna need it. I had a personal tragedy happen in my life. My girlfriend-- We were just walking down the street at night. We got jumped by three men. And, uh, one of the guys pushed me. And in my head, all I heard was\" Run.\" She'd been stabbed six times. I take blame for it every day. I just need to prove it to Irene and to myself that I'm worthy, that I'm good. Life doesn't stop for you. It doesn't wait to give you a break. It just... falls, and it keeps falling. I've been reading more of Kulik's diary. And he talks about a nomadic tribe, called the Evenki. And they are a group of people that we do not want to come in contact with. Now I don't want to scare anybody, but, uh, I believe that the trap that was set that got Irene, and the spear that had the message for us to get out... I believe it was... left by them. So what is this, some type of, like, Indian tribe or something? They're a nomadic tribe indigenous to this area. Guys, guys... come on. You-- you got to come outside right now.- What's wrong?- Come on. No, you gotta see this. You gotta see this. Come on, come on.- What is it?- Just come on. Can you tell us what it is? Daniel found this light. I guess it'd been there all the time. We just never saw it. See?- See it?- Yeah. That's where we gotta go.- I haven't seen that before.- What the hell is that?- I don't know. It's a light.- Whatever it is, we gotta go there. Wait a second.- They don't make--- That's about 10 miles, 15 miles.- That ain't that bad.- That looks far. That ain't that bad.- Let's think--- Take some food, water.- What if there's nothing over there?- Bottom line, though? Doesn't really matter how far it is if that's the only thing we got.- No, go in the morning.- Forest full of dangerous stuff. Go in the morning, right away, bright and early, as soon as the sun comes up. Well, what if nobody's there, also?- I mean, I guess--- There's nobody But there might not be anybody there, either. But it's worth a chance.- Daniel's right, guys.- It's our only hope, Sam.- Well, do you guys wanna go or not?- Perhaps he's right. I'm going in the morning. If you guys wanna go, that's fine. But I'm going. We don't even know what kind of terrain it is between-- It don't matter, man. That's our only chance. I think he might be right, guys. Well, we all don't need to go. Not all of us need to go.- Daniel?- Yeah. Wait up. Not everybody can go, anyway. We have Irene. Somebody's gotta stay with Irene, right? I want to stay. Definitely. Well, you can do that. I don't think anybody will complain. I think we go first thing in the morning. That way, we got plenty of daylight.- Uh- huh.- We got all day to travel. If we don't make it there in a day, we can at least set up camp for the night. Somebody can keep watch for a little bit while we take turns sleeping, you know? But you know, we give ourselves 12 hours of daylight... Mm- hmm. That's a lot of time to travel. All right. So now, we just decide who's gonna go. I'm going.- Sam?- I don't know what I'm doing yet. These woods are nothin' like I've ever seen, anyplace I've ever been to. You always feel like something is out there, watching... waitin'. You never feel safe. Gotta sleep with one eye open. I don't think we should.- Why not?- If everything that came out of the woods so far was very dangerous, why would there be an exception? I think we have to stay here, barricade cabins, and just learn how to defend ourselves. I agree with you, but look at Irene. I mean... I don't know. I-- I... I think we need to go get help. What are the chances of there being a town?- Anything's possible.- It's possible, but only if you go in the right direction, first of all. Yeah, but what is that tower? I mean, it's gotta be something. Right. What if there is somebody besides the production crew that knew we were here? I mean, there's gotta be someone else who knows. _ If you see anything scary, don't be a hero. I'll be back soon, okay? Daniel. Hmm? Here. Use this... if you have to. Okay? Okay. Are you coming? You think I'd let you get lost in the woods without me? Anyone else? Think they're staying. All right. There's something I wanna do first, guys. Come with me? Hey, what are you doing, man? It's just-- I don't know. There are some things I wanna say... on tape. You know, in case... something bad happens. Some things I wanna tell people. Come on. All right. I guess come with me, too. Hey. Can I... can I speak to Irene? Annie, it's okay. I'll be right outside, okay? Hi. I know this isn't gonna mean much to you right now, but I really want to... I just want to say how sorry I am. I, um... Yeah. I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I just, I... I got caught up in the game. And, um... So, Irene, I just... I want you to know that I am... really... really sorry. Keep everybody safe, man. Yeah. Mm- hmm.- Be careful out there, okay?- Yeah. You take care of her, too. Please. You ready? We move back out, all right, guys? Take care of them.

{"title": "Anger Management Charlie's Dad Starts to Lose It", "content": "Okay, we've exchanged make- up gifts for lashing out at each other, but the most important thing is to also verbally apologize. Especially when we... tried to blind somebody with perfume. Sorry, Nolan. It's okay. My eyeballs never smelled better. Changed someone's ringtone to\" Smack My Bitch Up.\" I'm sorry, Ed. Tried to put someone on the No- Fly List. Sorry about that, Lacey. If that is your real name. FYl, I'm already on the No- Fly List. Do not try to steal drinks from flight attendants' cause those hos are located here, here, and here. And referred to someone as...\" A giant piece of crap walking around in a bag of human skin.\" Sorry, me. It's okay, me. Oh, hey, everybody. Sorry, Charlie. I didn't realize you were in group.- I don't wanna interrupt.- It's okay, Dad. Are you gonna pick up some grapefruit later? I was really in the mood for grapefruit this morning. Yeah, sorry, Dad. I was busy, but I'll make sure I get everything on your list when I go to the store later.- And don't forget the pudding.- How could I? It was on your list twice underlined with stars and arrows.- I like pudding.- Is that what that meant? See you later, Dad.- And make sure you get the eight- pack.- The four- pack's a joke.- Oh, my God.- I'm sorry. I didn't wanna interrupt.- No problem, but you did.- Didn't mean to.- But continue to. So is your father living here now? No, it just seems that way because he showed up last week and now he won't go home. Tells me he had a problem with his plumbing. Maybe it's his building. Or maybe it's him with all that grapefruit and pudding. All right, let's get back to the session. I have a question. Nolan, you didn't do anything to me. Why did you give me a teddy bear? I just saw it and thought it could keep you company, you know, and if you're happy you can kiss it and if you're sad you can just hold it to your bosom. That is so sweet. Is that a camera, Nolan? What?! A camera? That guy ripped me off! What a bad man! Just once, I'd like a bear without a camera. Nolan, you really gotta examine this obsession you have with Lacey. Once again, you're attracted to someone who treats you badly and validates your low self- esteem. Really?'Cause I... Shut your loser hole. He's trying to help you. Can I interject something? See, I think the first step to feeling better about yourself is looking better. I mean, you could start by just making a couple of changes. For example, just... all of this and just all of this. Patrick, getting self- esteem is not as easy as a change of clothes. It takes hard work and it's a gradual process. Well, as a personal shopper, I see clothes transform people every day. It's like therapy except that it's faster and no one wears black shoes and white socks... Ed. Patrick, there's no reason to praise one profession at the expense of another. Even if one of those professions is selling clothes made by five- year- old, crying, Chinese girls. I wanna try to look good. Will you, uh, help me, Patrick? Well, I don't wanna get in the way of the glacial progress you're making here, but, yeah, sure. Let's give it a try. Did I mention that sometimes they shoot the girls for crying too hard? Sorry, Dad. Can I see you for a second?- It's about Grandpa.- Excuse me a second, guys. I know you're just the messenger, but if this is anything about grapefruit or pudding, I swear to God...- I just want you to see something.- Yeah. I don't know if we should be worried about Grandpa or not, but I found this. Why would Grandpa put his shoes in the refrigerator?- Is he okay?- Yeah, yeah, yeah.- He's fine.- Are you sure? Yeah... yeah, it's an old Irish tradition. When you go to someone's house, you put your shoes in their fridge as a sign of respect. Did you feel respected? So, why don't we complete the tradition by taking these shoes back up to Grandpa's room and pretending like this never happened.\u266a To you.\u266a In all my 65 years, I have never been this happy.- I thought you were 72.- The whole thing was a lie. You think I've never been this happy?- Yeah.- Don't you wanna answer that? Nah, just someone calling to wish me a happy birthday and make another stupid over- the- hill joke.\" What was it like to live when the dinosaurs roamed the Earth?\" It was like... mind your own damn business, buster.- People are so rude.- Yeah. But seriously, what was it like? You know, a lot of times the dinosaurs would kill the youngest member of the family for being a smart aleck. Sam, take your Grandpa and go watch that DVD we got him.- I'll bring in the cake and ice cream.- Great. Can't wait to see\" Grumpy Old Men\" again. Hope nobody cut their hand digging through the bargain bin by the check- out counter. Nice to know I'm worth a buck 99. So Sam told me that Martin put his shoes in the fridge. That doesn't sound good. Is he okay? He had a senior moment. You're always blowing stuff out of proportion.- People forget things.- Yeah, I guess. When you were on the road playing baseball, you used to forget we were married. All right, you got me. We're even now. Guess we don't have to talk about that anymore. Hey, excuse me. I gotta hit the john before we start the film.- Charlie, what are we animals?- What?- You should put a door on this thing.- Dad, Dad, Dad.- Stop, stop. It's not a bathroom.- What?- It's not a bathroom.- What? Oh, man. I am really sorry. I guess I got a little distracted.- You okay?- Yeah, I'm just really embarrassed and, uh, I still have to go to the bathroom.- There's one upstairs, right?- Yeah, it's the room without the beds. Charlie, you've really gotta take your dad to the doctor. Could be something serious like Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's? No, it's probably just another one of his tricks. Maybe he wants something. Maybe he wants to move in with me. You're right. Maybe nobody has Alzheimer's and one out of five old people just wanna live with you. All right, fine. I'll take him to the doctor, but I'm telling you, Jen, he just wants someone to wait on him hand and foot like his ex- wife used to. You really think he'd go that far? He'd pee in your pantry just to fool you? He's from a generation of people who still knew the value of hard work and commitment. There are those who look at a toilet and say,\" Why?\" He looks at a pantry and says,\" Why not?\" I really appreciate you doing this for me, Patrick.- I hope I don't let you down.- Are you kidding me? You're every stylist's dream. You're a blank slate with no style whatsoever. Thank you. All right, let's find out who is in there. Give me one word to describe yourself. Nolan. All right, you're gonna have to go a little bit deeper. Nolan. You know what, I have a pretty good sense of who you are, so let's just see what we can do to cover that up. Sounds good. There. Now that is the kind of shirt the commands respect. Wow. I respect it already. Here. Put this on. Oh, my... look at you. You already look like a different man. Oh, my God. I am. I look like Ryan Gosling. His assistant. You sure do. See, when you look better, you actually feel better about yourself. You're right. I do feel better. If I met myself in a bar... I'd talk to me. All we need to do is add this for just a splash of color. Uh, I should of told you. I... I don't like ties. No, I know it's a little formal, but now instead of looking like a guy who sells weed in an alley, you'll look like the guy in charge of a guy who sells weed in an alley. I... I... I don't care. Get get it off of me, get it off of me.- Would you just hold still? God, it's like Tarzan's first day in the city. It's a tie. It's not gonna hurt you. I can't breathe! I can't breathe! Well, now that we have learned something about you, here's something about me. I am very uncomfortable when people cry. Well, that is the last time I ever open up to you.- Yo.- Hi. So, how'd it go at the doctors? Is your dad faking it or does he really have the'Heimer's? The'Heimer's? Real sensitive. How's your mom's'kemia? Oh, it's in remish. Look, it helps me to deal with the heavy stuff by just giving it a little nickname. That's how I function. I learned that from a Jewish friend who lost his grandparents in the'Caust. You even have a nickname for the Holocaust? No, he lost'em at Costco. They wandered off. They had the'Heimer's. So how's your dad? Well, we took him to the doctor. He didn't do so well on the cognitive stuff. That doesn't prove anything. Tests are inconclusive. So there's no way to know for sure? Not until they do an autopsy. I tried to schedule one for tomorrow, but, you know, rules. So what's the next step? I don't know, but my gut tells me he's faking it. Maybe he tanked the tests on purpose. Well, what if he didn't? What kind of son are you if it turns out he's really sick? The kind that will spend the rest of my life wracked with guilt. I can't wait to find out. I need to know if he's faking it now. Good luck with that. You're gonna have to watch the guy all day to know for sure. That's why I'm gonna use this teddy spy cam. One of my patients left it behind. Yeah, I got one of those at home. I thought my housekeeper was stealing from me. Is this the hot one? Oh, yeah. So was she stealing from you? Not enough to let her go. It's always an ethical dilemma when the hot turn to crime. They belong in jail, but they're so hot. It's a good thing they didn't have hidden cameras like this when I was younger. I'm sure my parents would have used it to catch me doing something wrong. You guys had some trust issues? Yeah, and it only got worse when they found out I was sleeping with a college professor. You slept with a professor while you were in college? No! I would never do that. I was in high school. You are an endless wellspring of wow. Thank you. Can we go now? We've been watching your father for an hour and a half. All he's done is eat some pudding, do a crossword puzzle, eat some more pudding.- This could take days.- No, no, no, no. This is all proving my point. When I'm home it's all peeing in the pantry and shoes in the fridge, but look at him right now. He's as normal as you and me. Well, me. I didn't have sex with college professors until I was in college.- But you're not gonna see anything.- Yes, I am. I'll see enough to prove that my father's a big, fat liar. He hasn't done one thing out of the ordinary. He's using an ice cream sandwich as a remote control. No, he's not. He's using an ice cream sandwich as a remote control. Oh, my God. He's got the'Heimer's. Too easy.\u266a Twisted\u266a- Hey, Dad.- Hey.- How you doing?- I'm okay, but I think you need to get a refund on this subscription, though. They printed the whole magazine upside down.- Hold on. I think I have an extra copy.- Oh. Oh, thank you, son.- Mind if I have a beer with ya?- Not at all. Please, join me. Listen, I've been thinking. We should talk about you coming to live with me.- Permanently.- Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't do that, son. I mean, it's great fun living here, but I have to get back to my own place. I'm sorry, Dad, but it's just much safer if you're here,- so I can keep an eye on you.- What happened? Is it the results from those tests? That doesn't mean anything. No, no. You're sharp as ever. Just to be on the safe side, I'm gonna go to your apartment- and bring all your stuff back here.- No, no, no. You can't do that. No, I'll never give up my independence. By God, I fought in the war. Incoming! Take cover! Take cover, son! We gotta get outta here. All right, cease fire. At ease, Dad, at ease, at ease. Come on, come on. It's okay.- Oh.- It's okay. It's all right, come on. Oh, my. I'm so sorry. I get scared sometimes, son. It's okay. Why don't you sit down and let me fix you a club sandwich. With extra bacon? Sure, Dad. Extra bacon. Yeah, because, you know, I think I remember I like it crispy. Oh, hey. Sorry, I always fall asleep after a panic attack. Sucks when it happens in a supermarket or a bank. Well, I don't really know what to do now. I guess I should ask you if you wanna talk about it. I can't, it's too painful. Oh, thank God. I have packed you a to- go box, so I will see you in group.- I guess it all started with my dad.- Oh, crap. He was an ex- Marine from Texas. Scary man. There was a seven grade dance and I didn't wanna go'cause I was kinda awkward back then. You? No. And my dad said that I had to go to the dance and meet girls. So I hid under the bed and he pulled me out by my tie and dragged me by my neck all the way to the dance. Oh, my God. That's awful. It's like some sort of reverse\" Footloose.\" And to this day, I can't wear a tie.- I'm feel like I'm choking.- No, no, no, no. Don't do that. We've done that already. Just tell me what I can do to make it better. A hug would help. Yeah, so just let me know if you think of anything. I'd like a hug, Patrick. I'm sorry. I don't do comfort. It's my issue. I've just never been really good around other people's pain. But I'm working on it, though. Okay, I understand. I think I can drive home now. Great. So...- feel better.- Thanks. No one has ever listened to me without being paid before. Okey dokey.- Okay, that's enough.- Stay with it. You're doing great. Ride it out, big guy. You brought this on yourself, Nolan. Didn't your father have a whole collection of watches? I can't find them anywhere. Check the microwave? Like there's room in there with all his socks. Hello? We know you're in there, Martin. We can hear you. Get your ass out here, you coward! Wow. Don't stiff the Girl Scouts for cookies in this neighborhood. 45 years ago. You must be the girls from Troop one.- Who the hell are you?- It's obviously his son. Look at him. He's got Martin's face. Maybe that's why I wanna punch it. And to what do I owe this pleasure? We need to see your father. Martin, get out here! Whoa, slowdown. What is going on? This young man's father was having a relationship with me. While we were waltzing in the sheets down the hall. Hold on, hold on. Are you telling me that my dad, Martin, the patron saint of monogamy, was cheating with two women? Oh, my gosh. You make total sense now, Charlie. Cheating is genetic. He's been avoiding us ever since we found out about each other. We confronted him and he ran. We would have caught him, but he went up some stairs. So you were the ones that were calling all the time. He's such a liar. He actually told us he couldn't be responsible for his actions'cause he had Alzheimer's.- Geez, geez.- Wow. How stupid would someone have to be to believe a load of crap like that? He's your dad, Charlie. You wanted to believe him. I wanna confront him, but it might be too late. I hear he's getting pushed out of his son's window later this afternoon. Hey, Dad.- How was your day?- Oh, not so good, son. I couldn't even find the laundry room today. If a man can't do his own laundry, what's left of him? I guess, I'll just have to swallow my pride and let you do that for me, too. Damn this disease. Dad, sit down. I gotta talk to ya. You mean over there on the sailboat?- Yes, on the sailboat.- All right. Ah that's the rowboat.- Oh. Sorry. Listen, I got some bad news and I know that it's gonna be hard to hear. The results from your blood work came back and they found some kind of a rare bone disease.- What?- I know, I know. I couldn't believe it either, but there is something they can do. It's a marrow procedure that's extremely painful and takes a very, very, very long time. Oh, my God. But here's the good news. There is one day a week where you're not strapped down to the machine, but you spend most of that day in the bathroom. So you found out about Elaine and Barbara, huh? And you found out about the teddy cam. I saw it in a SkyMall magazine. Anyone who's ever gotten on a plane without any reading material could've figured that one out. Dad, I gotta tell you. What you did was disgusting. Oh, come on. Barb's not that bad and Elaine's got DlRECTV. I'm talking about faking Alzheimer's. Why didn't you just tell me you needed a place to hide out? Oh, Charlie. I've always ridden you so hard for being a womanizer. I didn't wanna give you the impression that I was,- you know a...- Hypocrite? Hey, just because you say one thing and do another, doesn't make you a hypocrite. Can we continue this conversation upstairs near a window? Look, I never meant for this to happen. Believe me. I had real feelings for both of them and I just couldn't choose. See, Barbara's a diabetic and Elaine's got melanoma, so I was kinda hoping God would choose for me. Well, he didn't. So now you gotta go back there and deal with them. Oh, no. After what I've done, they're both so angry.- I just don't know if I can handle it.- You won't have to do it alone. Luckily, your son is an anger management therapist.- I'll even mediate.- You'd really do that for me? I remember a dad who was always there when his kid got in a jam.- Mr. Kellerman down the street.- Yeah, I'm gonna do this for him. Oh, Charlie. They're gonna kill me. Dad, don't worry. Sure, they're gonna wanna yell at you and humiliate you and maybe even throw some stuff, but none of that will happen as long as I'm here. Oh. Barb. Elaine. He's all yours. Wait a sec! No, no, wait a minute. I didn't...

{"title": "Alcan Highway", "content": "- Hello.- Hi. Where are you?' I'm on the bus.- Are you going somewhere?- No. Where do you live now? Here and there.- How about the garage?- There's some water damage.- Is the Alaska thing still alive?- Of course. Do you think you can raise enough money for it? My idea of a motorhome included a bike repair space,- a studio, living and sleeping quarters. And a luxury bathroom at the heart of it. I tend to make ultra optimistic schedules. Perhaps it's my subconscious way of ignoring reality. I wouldn't start anything, if I made realistic schedules. I have a vague plan, but it changes all the time. It may produce nothing or turn into something else,- but that's what separates the artist from an engineer. Fuck! One, two, three...... nine... twelve.- I can't drive! 55!- This is a pretty good speed. If I go any faster, it starts shaking.- Is this her cruising speed?- Yeah.- It's quite slow.- Yeah. We're probably doing like 70... 60.- Can you see that on the GPS?- No. It says 6O kilometers an hour. 61 km/ h. We've got a long way to go. 64... 73... 74.- 218 degrees.- Hold on, that's not good. Just keep her going. And start listening to the motor. Anything over 220 I worry. What's the boiling point? 100 Celsius?- It's around 227, isn't it?- I don't know either. I used to know. I think it's 330 or 230. Let's hit every garage sale. Let's make our pact right now. As blood brothers we're gonna hit every car sale. Every old truck we're gonna stop, jerk off. That's what I'm gonna do anyway. Put your foot down and let's see how fast this thing can go. We're doing good now. It's not a fucking private car. I just wanna see how fast it can go. Fucker! For fuck's sakes!- There's smoke in.- You've gotta pull over. Fuck! Shut! I wanna write a song about this. It's called\" Hese Must Die.\"- That's not fair.- It's gonna be a catchy tune. Because more people commit suicide in your country. I hope you're gonna make a lot of money with that. I'll make a lot of money and I'll give you royalties.- One percent.- Thank you.- Hese, here's a sandwich.- Thanks. How's the ravioli? Is it in there? It's been in there for how long? It's hot. Here... it's hot. They're pretty good.- Sort of warm.- Who could've guessed? That's fine.- Claire wants to get married.- Yeah? Why don't you do it?- We will.- She's a good girl. I've just been through it, working, having nothing. I see all my friends. When they get married, they have nothing. They seem to do alright, but I can't imagine the stress. There's a lot of things I wanna do before marriage. You want to bang a bunch of hot Asians first. I just want to be able to get a piece of property. All the things that happen when you get married. You can do that with her, as a team you can get that. Marry her as long as you'll be able to get kids.- She doesn't wanna have kids.- She will when you're married. You need a wife. Hese.- A rich wife.- Why not? A wolf mother. We haven't really had any major issues with the truck. I'm still pretty worried, though. We have to be wormed all the time. You never know what happens.- I'm not so wormed about the truck.- The schedule? Yeah, more like the schedule. I don't even really care about that. If we won't make it to Vancouver, no big deal. But I have to be able to catch a flight. In Prince George or White Horse.- We're gonna be in White Horse today.- Hopefully. If we make a decision to continue- and I don't catch a flight and we get stopped- in a place where I don't have any cell- phone coverage,- I won't be able to call my boss and tell him that Fm stuck. He'll expect me back to work and I'm not gonna be there. It's the first good job I've had in my life. I actually like it. I go to work every day with a smile. I haven't forgotten for a second the whole time. I'm really sorry it took so long in Wasilla,- but the last day fix- ups were crucial for the trip. We wouldn't be here without that. I think you should try and enjoy what's going on here. Yeah, I'm never gonna be up here again. If shit happens, it's bound to happen. We can't avoid it. Part of my chaotic way of life is a counter reaction. It can be overwhelming to be too rational. My clad was extremely good at rationalizing and planning,- doing things to get them off the agenda. He did the same with saving for a house. He bought one home and started saving for the next one,- a bigger one as the family grew. Three sons, one per year. All according to plan. Dad thought it was practical- for the boys to be in the same stage at the same time. But the rationalization was also destructive. I struggled with the piano for year after year. Dad said we've played the piano so long- that we can't stop- although we sucked and made no progress. We hated it and wanted to stop. Dad said we would understand later why it's worth it.\" You've put in so many years you can't stop now.\" It must be hard for him to understand us. He probably thinks that rock'n' roll is just a phase.\" They'll move on to classical music later.\"\" Then they can play Schubert in the evenings,' in their own, cosy apartments.\" Fuck! Shit! Bloody hell. Fuck! Fuck! Goddammit. Bloody hell! Shit! Fuck! Dammit!

Did you see the card? How was it? Why are you wasting your father's provident fund? Grandma really likes the boy. You look happy. Do you like that Tukaram as well? I'm happy because I know...... you won't let me marry that Tukaram. By the way, what are you waiting for? For a big tender. You call your scams and thefts tender. I still have some shame left in me. Then why do such things in the first place? Because that's the only thing I know. People are restless.... and my mind is restless. Whenever I look at you... I feel like being good. ls that why you keep running away from me? I try, but I can't. The marriage is next week, Ajay. I know. What if you're caught? There's no one in this world who can catch me.

For reasons best known to him.- Yes. The minister isn't filing a case...... for reasons best known to him. It's a simple police case, sir. You do know that they...- But still, sir. Why indulge in such petty... Do you see that man? He's the Sl who helped them conduct the rain. Poor guy, he was humiliated. He conducted an investigation...... and gathered this information. There have been 13 such cases in the last 2 years. These are the ones that were detected. No one knows the real number of cases. Fake CBl, lncome Tax or ACB teams conduct a raid...... and the victims never report. Rumours are spreading. There's a theory that they're ex- CBl. Strange. Anyway, we've to stop this nonsense. They're slandering our name. Madras( Chennai), Nagpur, Trivandrum. Lucknow. Sir, it's all over the country. They mostly target businessmen and politicians. Because there's black money involved...... no one wants to report it. Which party do these politicians belong to, sir? They're from every party we know. I expect you to end this nuisance immediately. Yes, sir. Sir, I haven't received a promotion and increment yet. It's getting difficult to run the household. Shall I start accepting bribes?- Threatening me again. I'm discussing this matter. Consider it done from my side. Jai Hind, sir.- Jai Hind. And in that case all the four officers...... they posed as income tax officers.- Here, take this. Good morning, sir.- Good morning.

They made a fool of you, Mr. Ranveer. Yes. Will you tell me what exactly happened? It was the 26th of January. I was on duty. I received a call.' Tughlak Road police station, hello.'' Jai Hind.'' Jai Hind.- Who's this?'' Sl Ranveer Singh.'' This is Ajay Singh from CBl ward 16.'' From additional director PK Sharma's office.'' Who is the officer on duty?- That's me, sir. We need some men, to conduct a raid.'' How many, sir?'' Fourjunior constables, and one lady constable along with you.'' That will be enough.- Where's the raid?'' Even we don't know that.'' Only Mr. Sharma knows.'' Meet us at Safdurjung in 15 minutes.'' Jai Hind.- Jai Hind.' Four of them.- Yes, sir. Then? Then...' You just can't barge in here...'' Keep the phone down.'' Believe me, there's nothing in here.'' Madam, please step aside.'' Guddu's papa, stop them.- Let go of him.' Ranveer Singh, did someone tell you or did you... lf you had been in my place then... lf I had been in your place this situation would've never come up. I didn't join the CBl to screw up! I admit my mistake, Waseem sir. I don't have to listen to your taunts. I came here because I needed your help. lf you help me we can solve this case quickly. Otherwise, don't be mistaken that I've admitted defeat. It will take me longer alone...... but, I won't rest until I don't put an end to this. That's what I wanted to hear. Co- ordinate with all the police stations.- Yes, sir. And Ranveer, you will check all the police records yourself...... because you're the only one who have seen them.- Sir.

Aggarwal Traders?- Poddar Traders. 124?- 214! What's this? Why do you mess up? Can't you see the numbers properly? You'll make me lose my job. You've grown old. We were supposed to go to 124...... instead you brought us to 214. See?- Sorry, sir. Sorry! It's time for you to retire.- Yes. It happens sometimes. Things mess up. It's ok. Sorry, it was a slight blunder. You can continue. You can get on with yourjob, and we'll get back to ours. Let's go.- Yes. Aggarwal Traders. We're from the lncome Tax. No calls allowed. None. Sir...- Quiet. Sir, there's nothing.- Where's the key? Where's the key?- Sir...- Get it. Sir, the accounts... Sir, what have you done? I told you won't find anything.- Shut up. Come on.- Sir, sir...

Goodnight Goodnight.- Goodnight.- Goodnight.- Goodnight. Sleep well.- Goodnight. Who is it? Who is it?- Room service, sir. The queen of my dreams, when will you come. Life is passing by, when will you come? Come in. How are you, Mr. Sharma? We're from the CBl. The real one. So, Mr. Sharma. You like playing cops- and- robbers, don't you? No, I was just... I will ask you some questions, and you will have two options. Firstly, you will deny everything...... and say you don't know anything. ln that condition, we'll be compelled to do it and...... in places, which was never done to you before by anyone. It will cause you a lot of pain but, believe me...... you will suddenly remember everything in detail. I... I... Your second option is that you cooperate with us...... and save our time and effort. This option won't cause you any pain...... and you can expect us to be slightly lenient with us. So, let's begin. First question, where's your fake CBl team...... going to conduct a raid tomorrow? Bhuvandas Singhania Jewels. What time?- 3 pm. What's Special 26? It... was a big place, so we thought...... if we have more men with us... So you put an ad in the paper...... stating Come one, come all, it's a big heist. Help us. What's the plan? Tomorrow morning we'll give them training. Training? I mean we'd explain them their role...... like what to do, how to do it. We would explain them all that and prepare them. And then at 2: 30, our bus would reach the hotel. Then? We were supposed to go to Opera House in it...... and conduct a big raid. We're from the CBl! No one moves! Come on, start. Come on, get it. Get in, quickly. Come on, come on, quickly. Hurry up. Sir.. please sir.. sorry sir.. Pick up everything. We would flee before anyone knew what happened? We planned to loot 2 crores in 30 minutes. What's your Ajju's background? He wanted to join the CBl. He had cleared the written exam. But failed in the interview. He failed in the exam and he was hurt. So he started a fake CBl team. How many raids have you conducted so far? We were supposed to complete half century tomorrow. What the... I've to admit one thing. There's just four of you...... but you've spread a chaos. Not four. People like him help us as well. Sir, can I talk to him in private for a minute? Why a minute, you can talk to him all you want tomorrow. Yes. So, tell us, Mr. Sharma. Do you want to be safe or go down with them? Let me tell you...... jail isn't a great place for people of your age. Sir... sir, another option. I've children. You should've thought that before. I did... Tell us. We don't have time. Mr. Sharma. What will I have to do? Just do as you were supposed to. Forget that we ever met. Everything should go as it was supposed to. Let me tell you, that a few of our officers...... are in your Special 26 team. So don't try to act smart. I want to arrest them, not kill them. What's wrong? I just remembered something. Ajju always said There's no one who can catch him. Over- confidence has led to the downfall of many, Mr. Sharma. Ajju's no different. Will you treat him too harsh... Stop worrying about him and think about yourself. Get some sleep. You've a busy day tomorrow. Goodnight. Brief More and Gupte again. We'll meet tomorrow morning. Goodnight.- Goodnight, sir. Sorry.- It's okay. Sir. All that money for one drink? How much?- 30 ml. Anything smaller?- No, sir. Fine. Get me this one. Okay, sir. Hello. Hello. Waseem.- Wardhan.

Also, your dad phoned. Mainly about the government. He seems very cross with them, I've got several pages on that. I said I'd look into it. I fixed that rattling noise in the washing machine, indexed the kitchen cupboards, optimised the photosynthesis in the main flowerbed and assembled the quadrocycle. Assembled the what? I found a disassembled quadrocycle in the garage. I don't think you did. WHlSPERS: I invented the quadrocycle! What happened to me? Don't you remember? I was scared. Really scared.

Oh yes, you're a governess, aren't you, just like... Just like what? Just like... I thought you probably would be. Are you going to explain what happened to me? There's something in the Wi- Fi. OK. This whole world is swimming in Wi- Fi. We're living in a Wi- Fi soup! Suppose something got inside it. Suppose there was something living in the Wi- Fi, harvesting human minds, extracting them. Imagine that. Human souls trapped like flies in the World Wide Web, stuck for ever, crying out for help. Isn't that basically Twitter? What's that face for? A computer can hack another computer. A living, sentient computer... Maybe that could that hack people. Edit them. Rewrite them. Why would you say that? Because a few hours ago you knew nothing about the internet. And you just made a joke about Twitter. Oh. Oh. That's weird. I know all about computers now in my head. Where did that come from? You were uploaded for a while. Wherever you were, you brought something extra back. Which I very much doubt you're going to be allowed to keep. CRACKLlNG AND WHlRRlNG You and me, inside that box, now. I'm sorry? Just get inside.

Please tell me what is happening! I'm the Doctor. I'm an alien from outer space. I'm 1, 000 years old. I've got two hearts. And I can't fly a plane, can you? No! Fine, let's do it together.

I ain't waiting till breakfast. It's a time machine. You never have to wait for breakfast. APPLAUSE Thank you, thank you. Yes, magic blue box. All donations gratefully accepted. Roll up, roll up, give us your dosh. Pennies, pounds, anything you've got. Keep collecting, we need enough for breakfast. Just popping back to the garage. Garage? This way. So, this is tomorrow, then? Tomorrow's come early. No, it came at the usual time. We just took a short cut. Thank you, thank you. Tomorrow, a camel! Clara! What's happening? Blue box. Southbank! Definitely wasn't there five minutes ago. Are we sure this time? Earl's Court was an embarrassment. If you've got a flying time machine, why are we on a motorbike? I don't take the TARDlS into battle. Because it's made of wood? Because it's the most powerful ship in the universe and I don't want it falling into the wrong hands. OK? I do love London. So many cameras. So if we can travel anywhere in time and space, why did we travel to the morning? What's the point in that? Whoever's after us spent the whole night looking for us. Are you tired? Yes. Then imagine how they feel. They came the long way round. They've got to be close, definitely London, going by the signal distribution. I can hack the lowest level of their operating system, but I can't establish a physical location, the security's too good. Are you an alien? I am, yes. OK with that? Fine, yeah. I think I'm fine. Oh, good. So what happens if you do find them? What then? I don't know. I can't tell the future, I just work there. You don't have a plan? You know what I always say about plans? What? I don't have one. People always have plans. Yes. Yes, I suppose they do. So tell me, how long have you been looking after those kids? About a year, since their mum died. OK. But why you? Family friend, I get that, but there must have been others. Why did it have to be you? I mean, you don't you don't really seem like a nanny. Gimme! Sorry, what? You need to know where they physically are. Their exact location. Yes. I can do it. Oi! I need that! You've hacked the lower operating system. I'll have their physical location in under five minutes. Go and get a coffee. If I can't find them, you can't. They uploaded me, remember. I've got computing stuff in my head. So do I. I have insane hacking skills. I'm from space, and the future, with two hearts and... 27 brains. And I can find them in under five minutes, plus photographs. 27? OK, slight exaggeration. Coffee- go get. Five minutes, I promise. The security is absolute. It's never about the security, it's about the people. Why do you keep looking at me like that? Sorry, no, it's nothing. It's just... you're a nanny. Isn't that a bit... Victorian? Victorian? You're young, shouldn't you be doing, you know, young things? With- with- with... young people? What, like you, for instance? Down, boy! No, no, I didn't... Shut up! HE GASPS SHE GlGGLES Ooh! Two more cappuccinos over there, please. One moment, sir. CRACKLlNG You realise you haven't the slightest chance of saving your little friend? Sorry, what? I said one moment, sir. I said, there is not the slightest chance you can save your little friend. And don't annoy the old man, he isn't, in fact, speaking. I'm speaking. Just using whatever's to hand. Oh, she's rather pretty, isn't she? Do you like her? I can make her like you too, if you want. You all right, sir? Um, yes. Yes, fine. You OK? Sure, setting up stuff, need a user name. Learning fast. Clara Oswald for the win! Oswin! You could always call me Oswin, seeing as that's my name. Now I want you to take a look around. Go on. Have a little stroll. And see how impossible your situation is. Go on. Take a look, I do love showing off. Just let me show you what control of the Wi- Fi can do for one. Stop! Stop! TV CONTlNUES PLAYlNG I saw what you can do last night. And clear! We can hack anyone in the Wi- Fi, once they've been exposed long enough. So there's one of your walking base stations somewhere close. There's always... Someone close. We've released thousands into the world. They home in on the Wi- Fi like rats sniffing cheese. There's something up with the webcams. SHE GlGGLES I don't know who you are or why you're doing this but the people of this world will not be harmed, they will not be controlled, they will not be... The people of this world are in no... Danger whatsoever. My client requires a steady diet of living human minds. Healthy, free range human minds. He loves and cares for humanity. In fact, he can't get enough of it. It's obscene. It's murder. It's life. The farmer tends his flock like a loving parent. The abattoir is not a contradiction. No- one loves cattle more than Burger King. I'm sure of it, someone's hacking the webcams. All of them. Everybody check your webcams! But what would be the point, taking mug- shots of us lot? Who's on Facebook? Bebo? Myspace? Habbo? Put your hands down if you didn't mention where you work. This ends. I am going to the end this today! How? You don't even know... Where we are. Who's doing this? Who is your client? Hmm? Answer me! KNOCK ON DOOR Miss Kizlet, we have a problem! I did it. I really did, I did it. I found them. You found them. The Shard. They're in the Shard.

I don't know where I am. Doctor, help me. CHATTERlNG: Help! Help! Please! Should we pulp her? Or keep her as a hostage? There's no point, she's fully integrated now, she can't be downloaded again. I'm sure he knows that. I'm not sure he does. He's coming. We could stop him, I suppose. Why bother? It might be quite funny. Really, Doctor, a motorbike? It hardly seems like you. I rode this in the Anti- Grav Olympics, 2074. I came last. The building is in lock- down. I'm afraid you're not coming in. Did you even hear the word Anti- Grav? ENGlNE ROARS Seriously? He can do that? He can really, actually do that? Oh... Dear... Lord. LOUD CRASH I think that was your office. Excuse me, I believe it's someone to see me. Do come in. Download her. Sorry about the draft. Download her back into her body, right now. I can't. Yes, you can. She's a fully integrated part of the data cloud now. She can't be separated. Then download the entire cloud. Everyone you've trapped in there. You realise what would happen? Yes, those still with bodies to go home to would be free. A tiny number. Most would simply die. They'd be released from a living hell. It's the best you can do for them, so give the order. And why would I do that? Because I'm going to motivate you. Any second now. You ridiculous man! Why did you even come here? Whatever for? I didn't. What? I'm still in the cafe. I'm finishing my coffee. Lovely spot. What are you talking about? You hack people. Me? I'm old- fashioned. I hack technology. Here's your motivation! CLlCKlNG AND WHlRRlNG No. No. No! Not me! Not me! Put me back! Put me back! Download me at once! That is an order! That is an order! But she's fully integrated now. We'd have to download the entire cloud. We can't do that. No. We can't. Download me! Download me! CRACKLlNG Do what she says! Doctor? Doctor! Doctor! You have no right to be in this office, and I am demanding that you leave at once! This building is under UNlT's control. What is UNlT? I've never heard of you! I suggest you calm down, sir. UNlT are here, friends of the Doctor, I presume. Oh, old friends, very old friends. Then I appear to have failed you, Great Intelligence. I have feasted on many minds, I have grown. But now, it is time for you to reduce. You've been whispering in my ear so long, I'm not sure I remember what I was before. Goodbye, Miss Kizlet. BUZZlNG AND SCREAMlNG Sorry, where am I? What am I doing here? Are you soldiers? What's happening? How did I get here? Excuse me, where are the toilets? The toilets? I'm here to fix the toilets, the gents. How long have I been here? Stay where you are! Ma'am, identify yourself! Where are my mummy and daddy? They said they wouldn't be long. Are they coming back? KNOCK ON DOOR Come in. So. He comes back, does he? You didn't answer my question. What question? You don't seem like a nanny. I was going to travel. I came to stay for a week before I left and during that week... She died, so you're returning the favour. You've got 101 places to see, and you haven't been to any of them, have you? That's why you keep the book. I keep the book cos I'm still going. But you don't run out on the people you care about. Wish I was more like that. You know, the thing about a time machine, you can run away all you like and still be home in time for tea, so what do you say? Anywhere. All of time and space, right outside those doors. SHE LAUGHS Does this work? Eh? Is this actually what you do? Do you just crook your finger and people just jump in your snog box and fly away? It is not a snog box! I'll be the judge of that! Starting when? Come back tomorrow, ask me again. Why? Cos tomorrow, I might say yes. Some time after 7. 00 OK for you? It's a time machine, any time's OK. See you then. Clara? Uh- huh? In your book there was a leaf, why? That wasn't a leaf, that was page one. Right then, Clara Oswald. Time to find out who you are. METALLlC THRUMMlNG What do you want to see? Something awesome.

{"title": "Through the Wormhole How Do Aliens Think", "content": "Freeman: Do aliens think in ways we could ever understand? Do all forms of intelligence share the same underlying pattern-- a pattern we are only now beginning to see? By studying the nonhumans in our midst, scientists are learning how alien minds function. Their discovery-- that emotions may be more important than logic, and bodies matter as much as brains. We may soon know how aliens think. Space, time, life itself. The secrets of the cosmos lie through the wormhole.-- Resync by Iscol@ HDVietNam. com we know that the stuff of life is spread throughout the cosmos. Odds are that aliens are everywhere. Will alien brains think like ours? Will they have brains at all? Without an alien to study, these seem impossible questions to answer. But we're not alone on this planet. If we want to know how aliens think, we can start by looking closely at the alien minds here on earth. I used to look at my dog and wonder,& quot; What's going on in there?& quot; did she think the way I did? At least my dog seemed part of the same world as me. Other creatures seemed utterly alien. Is it possible that all life possesses some form of intelligence, but sometimes so different from our own that we fail to see it? Could a form of alien thought be right under our noses? We believe plants cannot think or feel. But what if we're wrong? A ground swell of new research suggests plants possess a form of intelligence entirely alien to our own. Most plants can smell, taste, touch, and perhaps hear, and, according to these two researchers, they may even talk. Consuelo de Moraes has doctorates in chemistry and biology. Mark mescher's background is in animal behavior and evolution. The duo's experiments have proven that plants behave in ways we normally only attribute to creatures with brains. I think what's alien about the way plants engage their environments for us as animals is that it's just so counterintuitive. Animals, and particularly humans, we're very visually oriented. We're very cognitively oriented. We're these problem solvers that are used to sort of encountering our environments and thinking about them and coming up with ways to solve problems. And plants are solving problems, but in a very different way of interacting with their environment. Freeman: Recently, mark and consuelo have used pheromone detecting machines and time- lapse cameras to study a leafless parasitic vine called cuscuta pentagona. Cuscuta exhibits a host of problem- solving behaviors we don't expect to see in plants. But this fascinating life form has a dark side. It may look like an ordinary vine, but in the plant world, it's a vicious serial killer. De Moraes: Cuscuta is a true parasite, so as opposed to most plants, they don't have roots. They don't really do photosynthesis, so in order to survive, they must attach to a host plant. They work like vampires, in a sense. They will take the resources out of the plant and then grow based on the resources from the host plant so they will not produce anything. They're true parasites. Freeman: As a cuscuta vine grows, it probes its surroundings the way we do with our hands when we search for the bathroom light in the middle of the night. The vine bends and grows until it finds something tasty-- say, a tomato plant. Then it probes downward until it finds the base of the stem, which it sinks its teeth into. It wraps itself around the plant and sucks out its vital juices, and strangely enough, cuscuta can smell whether its potential victims are healthy or not. De Moraes: We accept that animals can find the host based on smell. We see that all the time, right? It's just we don't think that plants have that ability, and I think that's what's fascinating, because we just have this line that we have drawn that says animals can do this but plants cannot. Freeman: Plants can also use smell to communicate. Some use odors to defend themselves against predators and warn each other of danger. For instance, caterpillars are eating the leaves of this soybean plant. The plant calls for help by releasing chemicals that attract wasps. The wasps sting the caterpillars to death. While this is going on, other plants smell the distress signal and release their own chemicals to ward off attack. Plants live on a different time scale from humans. Their actions unfold so slowly, we think nothing is happening at all. But plants defend themselves, communicate with other plants, recognize injured neighbors by scent, and sniff out meals. Plants predate the human race. They may well outlast it, so is it likely that their very alien form of thought and behavior could be found on other worlds? Mescher: The history of evolution on different planets may unfold in very different ways. I think we would be very likely to find something that was very similar ecologically to what plants do. I think they're able to take energy from starlight, basically, and convert that into biochemical energy that they can then use. That's just the base of the food chain, and it seems that that would be the logical place for an ecosystem to start, even on another planet. Freeman: The question is are plants on other worlds any better at thinking than the ones we know? Do alien trees contemplate their branches? Do alien flowers have nightmares about worlds with no sun? Perhaps alien plants have developed the complexity of thought it takes to become self- aware. This woman would say& quot; No.& quot; she believes that no life form here on earth or out in space can evolve complex thought until it has the ability to move and to sense the world as it moves through it. For cognitive scientist saskia nagel, the interplay of sensory input and bodily motion is the foundation upon which consciousness is built. For instance, I see this cup, I can feel this cup with my fingers, and also, I can sense the weight of this cup if I grab it. That's sensory input. Bit at the same time, closely coupled, my eyes move when I look at it, I have to move my arm to grab it, and I have to keep it like this if I want to sense the weight of it, and we think that the coupling of sensory processes and motor processes is what allows us to perceive. Freeman: Our idea of what it means to be conscious is inextricably tied to our specific human senses-- the ability to see, smell, hear, touch, and taste. But saskia believes that aliens could develop rich mental lives even if they sense their world in entirely different ways. To prove it, she's feeding an alien sense into the nervous system of a group of volunteers. By wearing a device called a feelspace belt, test subjects are learning how to feel the position of magnetic north. This gives them a perfect sense of direction. It's just a belt equipped with a number of vibrators. On the back side, there's a little compass-- a very good one, actually-- and a little computer at the other side down there, and the compass and the computer always tell one element of these vibration elements at the time to vibrate, and it's always that element that points north. Freeman: Today, saskia and her team have taken three volunteers into a forest. The volunteers put on blacked- out goggles. Next, they are spun around until they are disoriented. Now they have to find their way to saskia, who stands at a fixed position directly north. Ordinarily, they wouldn't stand a chance, but each volunteer has spent six weeks training with the belt. They have developed a built- in compass. Nagel: Actually, it's interesting that they don't feel the tactile stimulation anymore after the training. It is as if this new sense has always been there, and they really develop a different sense of space. Freeman: The day when we have solid evidence of how aliens think may be a long way off, but experiments like this give us a way of approximating what it's like in alien heads with an alien way of sensing the world. They show us the ability to think is not dependent on the senses we know. Logically, aliens would evolve senses tailored to their own particular environments. On a planet where light is dim, having a built- in radar system would be more valuable than the sense of sight. An alien could have a completely different set of senses and still dominate its world. But how do groups of aliens think? How do they communicate with each other, organize, and form sophisticated societies? The answer may be right under our feet. Your brain is like a maze of twisting railroad tracks. As neurons grow, they make trillions of connections, and out of this incredibly complex network arises the miracle of your mind. But who's to say it works the same way for intelligent life on other planets? What if the neural connections of alien brains are spread across many different bodies? Professor Nigel Franks is looking for an answer by closely studying the dominant form of life on earth-- insects. So, I've been working on ants professionally now for about 30 years, and every day, we have a successful experiment. They surprise and delight me, and I think the thing that's absolutely riveted me is now we know that ants are so much more sophisticated than we ever knew them to be. Freeman: When ants get together, they form a superorganism-- a large, intelligent life form made of small, not especially intelligent parts. Franks: What's special, I think, is that the way the ants communicate with one another, so the whole colony emerges effectively as a brain- like structure. Freeman: To see this mass brain in action, Nigel forces the ants to go house hunting. Franks: Right, so, in this experiment, we've taken one of our ant colonies. We've been really mean to them, because we've totally destroyed the nest that they've been living in, and what that means is they have to find a new home, and we've offered them a choice of two alternative nest sites. There's one over here, which is too light and got a very wide entrance, which is two things they don't like, versus this nest that they really should prefer because it's got a beautiful narrow entrance. It's got plenty of space for them to live in, and this red filter means that the nest is dark, and that's something they prefer, as well, so we would expect them to be able to choose this nest. And the beauty of this experiment is we should be able to work out exactly how they go about making this kind of decision. Freeman: Ants are picky shoppers. When they size up a new home, they carefully consider the height of the ceilings, the floor space, the width of the rooms, and the number of entrances. They will reject nests that have hygiene problems, such as the remains of a previous tenant. [ Screams ] Franks: If an ant likes a particular nest, it goes home to the colony and finds a receptive nest mate, and it leads it back to that nest site. Basically, the leading ant teaches a single following ant the route to the new nest site, then, if it likes it, as well, go home and recruit yet more. So 1 ant becomes 2 becomes 4 becomes 8 becomes 16, and when they build a sufficient number of their nest mates in the new nest site, they achieve what we call a quorum threshold, and that's the decision point that makes them commit to that particular nest site, and then they'll start carrying their nest mates there rather than leading them. Freeman: Recently, computer scientist James Marshall used Nigel's findings to create a sophisticated model of ant decision- making. Then something remarkable happened. James came upon another computer simulation that looked very much like the one he was working on. A colleague came to join my department from Princeton, where he'd been working on modeling primate decision- making circuits in the brain just around the same time I started making these computer and math models of ant colonies making decisions, and we went to each other's talks, and we were both really excited because we could see that each was basically looking at the same kind of system. Although one was an ant colony and one was a primate brain, they were both basically working in the same way to make decisions. Freeman: James realized that individual ants in a superorganism behave like the neurons in a single primate brain. Marshall: So, I think ants collectively process information in a very interesting way. No individual ant needs to know all the details about its environment, but by having a little bit of information and aggregating it together at the colony level, the colony can be well informed about the decision it's making, even if individual ants are less well informed, and that's analogous to neurons in the brain. No individual neuron really knows anything, but you stick a load of them together, and collectively, the brain does know something. Freeman: So, given enough time, could ant colonies become conscious? Are they already conscious? Franks: Well, I think one of the great differences between the way we solve problems and the way ants solve problems is the ants actually have to mingle with the problem to begin to solve it. And the great difference we have is that we can often play virtual- reality games in our heads to think about alternative scenarios and how we might solve the problem and what the consequences of that might be. So, what we do is stand back and think about things, whereas the ants really roll up their sleeves and get on with it. Freeman: Ant colonies can accomplish goals far beyond the capabilities of their individual members. But they can only think about things that are directly in front of them. They lack self awareness and the ability to imagine. Perhaps alien insects have these abilities. On earth, they do not. So, is there a nonhuman intelligence on earth that rivals us for thoughtfulness and innovation? This man says yes. He's studying a creature that may hold the secret to alien thought and the mystery of consciousness. Human brains are not the largest on earth, but they are the most complex. Our brains don't just think. They also are self- aware. They are conscious. Is consciousness unique to the human brain or could a creature with radically different brain architecture also be self- aware? The answers may lurk behind these unblinking eyes. Octopuses are invertebrates. They don't have spinal cords, yet they exhibit a level of intelligence we usually associate only with mammals. They appear to be thoughtful, clever, even calculating, but they are utterly unlike us. Octopuses are truly the closest thing to an alien life form of any degree of intelligence on the planet earth. Freeman: Neuroscientist David edelman studies the brain of the octopus, or more precisely, brains. It has more than one. In the common octopus, we have half a billion neurons, or nerve cells, more than half of which are in the arms, and those arms, in fact, are really, really interesting because you can almost characterize them as having their own miniature brain. Freeman: The multiple brains of the octopus act as a distributed processing system-- the arms feeding data to the head like a network of computer nodes feed data to a central hub. If one of the nodes is cut off, it can still function. Edelman: If you cut off an octopus's arm, that arm is actually able to execute a series of movements that are very, very coordinated, which is really intriguing, and you do not see that at all in any vertebrate. [ Arm murmuring ] Freeman: How do you work out what a creature with an alien brain is thinking? David's solution was to adapt intelligence tests made for mice and rats to octopuses. So, what you see here is a Barnes maze, which was originally designed for looking at memory and learning and actual visual navigation in rodents, and what we're doing here is we're checking the octopus's capability for visual navigation, and so what you see here is this fairly simple maze with 18 holes, but only one hole is a true hole that leads to an escape. The escape is into a container of its own seawater. But you also see these visual landmarks, and the idea behind this is to follow the animal as it learns the location of the various landmarks in relation to the one true escape hole. Freeman: The octopus has no problem finding its way out. Trials have shown that when the markers are moved, it will head towards what it believes to be the exit sign, even if it's no longer above the escape hole. Clearly, the animal plans, acts, and remembers. It's thinking at a high level of complexity, but is it conscious? Edelman: I define consciousness as the stitching together of all of the diverse sensory input that's coming into my brain-- visual input, sense of touch combined with auditory, what I hear-- and the remembrance of all of that stuff stitched together as a unitary whole. Freeman: So a creature with multiple brains could be conscious, but being conscious is not the same thing as being self- aware, and right now, we have no way of measuring either consciousness or self awareness. Edelman: If somebody were to ask me whether my dog is conscious, as a pet owner and a dog lover, I would say,& quot; Well, of course.& quot; She seems to be aware of her world.& quot; She seems to respond in ways that look remarkably familiar to me.& quot; but as a scientist, I have to demand evidence of consciousness in nonhuman animals who cannot report to me their internal conscious states. Freeman: The octopus's thoughts are a mystery and may forever remain a mystery. We may never know if it is self- aware or if it can contemplate its world. Can you think without words? Is there such a thing as thought without words? Well, you know, I might be in the minority, but I happen to think that you probably can. I think that there can be visual thoughts. It's very hard for us as humans to imagine that because, of course, every time we think, language breaks in. What will alien languages be like? Would theirs and ours have anything in common? The evolution of language on earth may hold the answers to whether humans and aliens can one day communicate or be hopelessly separated by our uncommon tongues. Human evolution has been going on for roughly 5 million years, and that's just a blip in the 13. 5 billion- year history of creation. Chances are we are not the smartest creatures in the universe. If we met aliens far more advanced than us, could we communicate? Would we speak the same language? What would language be like for a species a million years older than us? Professor Simon Kirby sees language as a living thing that evolves over time. The sheer variety of languages on earth, 6, 000 unique tongues, are mirrors of how we think and how thought may change in the future. Right now, we're doing something pretty extraordinary. I'm breathing out slowly while at the same time moving my tongue, jaw, and lips in an incredibly fast ballet of movement. I can use this skill to take a thought that's in my head and transfer it into yours. Freeman: Simon wants to know why this happens. Kirby: How did we end up having a language with a particular kind of structure that allows us to talk about anything? It turns out, surprisingly, that we can get a clue to the answer by looking at a simple game like broken telephone. In the game of broken telephone, a sentence evolves as it's passed from player to player, but it doesn't evolve biologically. Rather, it evolves through a process of cultural evolution. Thanks. So, the original sentence was,& quot; The survival of certain words in the struggle for existence is natural selection.& quot; and what you guys turned it into was,& quot; Longer existence is not longer existence.& quot; [ laughter ] Freeman: The sentence seems to have mutated from sense to nonsense. But Simon argues what's significant is the sentence became shorter and easier to learn. That is how language evolves. So, the broken telephone game acts as a kind of miniature version of cultural evolution. So what's happening is that each player in the game is hearing a sentence and mapping it somehow into their brains briefly and then trying to reproduce it again. Because that process is imperfect, the sentence can evolve over time, so the sentence we get at the end is different from the one at the start, and what's happened is that that sentence has adapted in some way to the brains of the people playing the game. Freeman: Proving this scientifically is difficult because language doesn't leave a fossil record behind to study. Simon tackles this problem by creating alien languages word by word, then watching them adapt to human brains. So, we wanted to see if we could re- create the cultural evolution of language in the lab, whether we could study something that take hundreds of years and see it happen in basically an afternoon. So what we did is we set up an experiment where we teach a volunteer an alien language that we've made up and then test them on it. So in the setup, we have a bunch of alien fruits that have names, but every name is different. And this language is essentially impossible to learn. Okay, Adam, so, now I'm gonna ask you to try and identify some of these alien fruits for me. Pohumo. That one. Wagahuki. Freeman: Virtually no one is able to remember the words correctly. Okay, I'm afraid you actually got none of those correct, so sorry about that. But that's okay. Now Adam will write down what he thinks the words were, and then this new set of words will be taught to the next volunteer. This volunteer would write down her version of the words, and then those words will be taught to the next person. Kirby: So, towards the end of the experiment, participants that are coming in and learning the language after it has, if you like, washed through the brains of some of our earlier participants, suddenly seem to do better. In fact, towards the end of the experiment, our volunteers can name all the fruit that we show them, even ones they've never seen before. Well done. That's all of them correct. Congratulations. And what's happened here is that the language has evolved. It has evolved structure, and it turns out that the mistakes people make will tend to be the kinds of things that other participants can learn, so every mistake one generation makes makes the language easier to learn for the next generation. Freeman: So, communicating with an ancient alien race may not be so difficult after all. If language evolution follows similar patterns on other worlds, an alien tongue could be easy to learn. But don't expect the aliens to be smart. If we look at how humans work today, we store information online. We share information online on these massive networks, and we basically find out any information we want instantly, so perhaps an alien civilization would have gone further down this road. I can imagine evolution taking us in a direction where less and less is needed of our brains, as it were-- of our biology-- because more and more of that is taken on by the cultural system that we're building around us, so perhaps we will get more and more stupid biologically and more and more smart culturally over time. Freeman: Clever or not, aliens would need language to have civilization. But would they need speech? Why bother to talk if you can share your thoughts directly via mental telepathy? How might aliens communicate? We speak. Language lets us transmit our thoughts into other people's brains. But language might not come in the form of speech. What if complex life evolved on a planet where communication by sound was impossible? A different way of transmitting information might evolve. What if aliens are telepathic? It's already happening here on earth. Today, this man's thoughts will be detected and transmitted by a machine. It's part of a revolutionary project led by university of California at irvine neuroscientist Mike d'zmura. We call it a brain- computer interface. We use e. E. G. To measure the faint signals generated by the brain when a person thinks. Our goal is to analyze the e. E. G. Signals to determine what it is the person is thinking. We can then send the phrases to some other person using any number of means, including e- mail or text messaging. Freeman: Mike is testing whether this man can use the brain waves generated when he imagines two different syilables as a form of telepathic morse code. D'zmura: They're two syilables presented at the beginning of trials. These are either& quot; Wo& quot; Or& quot; Fi.& quot; if our subject hears& quot; Fi,& quot; Then he thinks& quot; Fi.& quot; fi. [ Beeping ] If he hears& quot; Wo,& quot; Then he thinks& quot; Wo.& quot; wo. [ Beeping ]& quot; Fi& quot; Could be used to communicate the short element of morse code,& quot; Di.& quot;& quot; Wo& quot; Can be used to communicate the long element of morse code,& quot; Dah.& quot; Freeman: The meta- morse- code tests have been stunningly successful, with an accuracy rate near 100%. This synthetic telepathy technology exploits an error correction mechanism in the brain. When the brain sends a command to the motor cortex, it also creates an internal impression known as an efference copy of what the resulting movement would look and feel like. [ Groans ] Mike and his collaborators realized that if they could read these efference copies in the brain, synthetic telepathy could advance to the next stage, transmitting thoughts not just in morse code, but in common phrases. Finding and isolating an efference copy in the electrical jumble of the mind is no easy thing. The exact location of neural activity is difficult to discern because the scalp, skull, and cerebral fluid surrounding the brain scatter its electric signals before they reach the electrodes of an e. E. G. The real problem is the signal- to- noise ratio. At the moment, I am speaking to you right now. You are listening, and this is generating activity in your brain. Let's suppose that this brain activity is what we would like to detect. This is the signal. Well, if it were the only thing going on in your brain, it wouldn't be so hard. However, there are many things that your brain is doing simultaneously. It's controlling your heartbeat. [ Drum beats ] It's controlling the rate of breathing. [ Saxophone plays ] We are constantly scanning our external environments. [ Guitar plays ] It generates thoughts that rise up into consciousness. [ Accordion plays ] Now, suppose that all of these things are going on simultaneously behind the skull. [ All instruments play ] This is similar to all of the sources of noise in a recording studio behind a thick plate of glass. [ Fading ] Pretty soon, it's gonna be impossible to hear the signal. [ All instruments playing ]... great problem that we face in signal processing. Freeman: So far, Mike's software is able to identify words in the subject's brain about half the time. But advances in synthetic telepathy are coming quickly. Someday, we may be able to project our thoughts through the ether, and if we can do it, it could be standard equipment for an alien species. I can easily imagine that there are other species out there who may actually be better at signaling things through interfaces such as e. E. G. So I can imagine, for instance, a species whose motor areas are not buried behind an extraneous piece of brain, but rather on the surface. Freeman: This alien species could learn to pool its thoughts, much as ant colonies form superorganisms, but with vastly more brainpower augmented by machines. The thinking power of this alien meta brain could dwarf anything we can imagine. But could a society that communicates by thought endure? If you think you get too many texts and e- mails now, what happens when people don't even have to go to the trouble of typing? On earth, instant communication seems to cause as many problems as it solves, perhaps because our messages are loaded with emotion. We presume that isn't an issue for mentally advanced aliens. Surely, they are logical, machinelike beings beyond emotion. But this woman believes with her heart and her mind that thinking and feeling are two sides of the same coin. Like us, aliens may emotions. Science fiction often depicts advanced alien species as cold, emotionless beings of pure intellect-- basically, computers with legs. According to this line of reasoning, emotions are primitive urges that merely cloud our thinking. But would a mentally superior species necessarily be devoid of feelings? Or could aliens have a heart? Psychologist Lisa Barrett's groundbreaking research reveals that language, memory, and even rational thought all depend upon emotion. Barrett: When you feel angry, you experience this as very different from when you're having a memory or when you're thinking something or when you're perceiving something like a beautiful flower. Those seem to you to be very, very different kinds of experiences, but at the level of the brain, there are common networks that are active during all of those events. Freeman: The notion that our emotional and rational minds are entirely separate dates black to Plato, who saw emotions as savage, brutish instincts. [ Groans ] Charles Darwin argued that emotions are evolutionary holdovers from animals which no longer serve any useful purpose, like our vestigial tailbones. Humans of the future, or any alien species far along the evolutionary trail, will not be burdened with feelings. But according to Lisa, you can't separate reason from emotion. In her lab at northeastern university, Lisa studies how emotions shape thought. She does this by altering people's core affect-- the basic state of mind that underlies complex emotions, and she does this without their knowing it. Barrett: So, subjects come into the laboratory, and using specialized equipment, we present different images to the left and the right eye. To one eye, we will present flashing images-- let's say mondrian- type image of artwork-- embedded in visual noise. To the other eye, we present a static image of either a neutral face, a smiling face, or a scowling face. Freeman: When one of your eyes is shown a flashing image and the other eye is shown a still image, you are only conscious of seeing the flashing image, but the still image nonetheless reaches your subconscious mind. By measuring skin conduction, heart rate, breathing, and vascular resistance, Lisa detects her subjects' unconscious responses to the hidden faces and then measures how this affects their thinking. She's found that people exposed to the static smiling face are more likely to find the mondrian- type image beautiful. But when the hidden face is frowning, they don't like the picture. It's not the case that we're impassively viewing things in the world and then having reactions to them. Our affective feelings are actually influencing what we see and how we make judgments about what we see. Freeman: Whether we know it or not, emotions determine how we think and what we pay attention to. Your affect helps you to allocate your attention, for example, towards me and ignore all the other sources of information that you could potentially be paying attention to. Affect also helps you to sharpen your perception of the thing you're paying attention to. Freeman: If emotions are essential to consciousness and self- awareness, then aliens will certainly have them. They will use them the same way we do-- to realize their goals... Yay!... to define their personalities... [ Grunts ]... to make sense of their world. The true nature of alien thought would probably defy our speculations. It may well be beyond our understanding, but by studying the minds of the aliens here on earth, we have learned much about ourselves and the gift of having brains that can think, feel, and communicate. One day, when we finally engage with alien minds, we will find out whether consciousness, emotion, and imagination are unique to us or spread throughout the stars. Right now, we have no way of knowing.

You see Dane filed a motion to set aside the default judgment? It's never gonna fly.- Dane's a punk.- Punk, yeah. Don't tweet that. You're no fun. Still okay to take the Harlowe deposition tomorrow? I got a thing in the morning. Not a problem. I'm here to serve. Thank you. So unfair. You're stunning today. We're going to a funeral, Dominic.- It's not mine.- Get in the car.( Bell tolling)( Indistinct conversations) Save me a seat. Karen, what are you doing here? Savi, hi. Where have you been? April and I must've left you a hundred messages. We thought you died. Oh. I am so sorry. That was so rude. Miss Kim, Mrs. Grey's requested you sit with the family. I'll call you later.( Organ playing)( Thomas) This is what I want to remember. Mm.( Man)* I can't wear the same suit*\u266a on the town without you\u266a\u266a waiting to find that same look in her eye\u266a You're shivering. Are you cold? No. I'm fine. might be the best thing that's ever happened to me.\u266a You still are on me\u266a Oh. No. No. No. No. No.( Crying) Do you love me, Karen? Yes, I do. Then when it's time... would you help me die?( Organ playing) Oh, Karen. Thank you for being here. This is our son Sam. I'm so sorry for your loss. Dr. Kim was dad's therapist, and a savior these past few years. Miss, I've heard a lot about you. Please. Welcome, everyone. Today we are gathered to grieve the death and to remember the life of Thomas Winton Grey.( Bell tolling) Dr. Kim, before you go... Sam. Hi. Beautiful eulogy. Mostly lies. I hardly knew him. You were there a lot towards the end, my mom said. Yes, I was. There are things I'd like to discuss with you when my mother isn't around. I'm sorry, but I don't... My father was having an affair.( Savi) Karen. I'll find you at the wake. We can talk more. If I knew you were gonna be here, we could've carpooled. I know. I forgot you worked for him. Yeah. A founding partner. But our paths very rarely crossed. And how did you know him? He was a patient. Oh. So do you have to go to the wake?( Man)... To get them all together. No, I don't think so. Then you're gonna come with me to Lucy's birthday party. April's daughter. Right. I don't think I should go. I don't have a gift. Oh, neither did Joss. Just put your name on our card. Come on.\u266a Mm- hmm. Karen, God, we've missed you. What have you been doing these past few months? to be wasting all this action on mental cases.( Laughs) Honestly, I wish I had something more interesting to tell you guys, but I've just been working nonstop. What about you? Are you seeing anyone? She could be if she'd let me set her up. No, you lost those privileges when you infected my phone with sex apps. Ladies, you've got to start using technology to your advantage. There are a million guys out there. Is it still Paul? I know. It's been too long. He was your husband. Three years isn't that long.( Girls laughing)- Tell her about the ghost.- I was waiting for this.- About the what?- Don't listen to them. They're just gonna make it sound worse than it is. She's been getting prank phone calls. There's no one on the other line, and she's convinced it's Paul. Look, it's not as insane as it sounds. Literally the day after I deposited the insurance check... Oh, so the check finally came. Yeah, and after all those legal battles, I took it as a sign to move on. And then the calls started. I pick up the phone and no one's there. It's just really quiet breathing. In my heart, I... I feel like it's Paul. Dead Paul telling me not to move on.( Balloon pops) Oh! Oh. Sorry. That... that wasn't us. The door was open. Oh. Hi. You... you must be Madison's dad. Yeah. Hi.- Uh, Richard.- April. Um, we were wondering if Madison was gonna make it. Are we late? Oh, I am so sorry. My ex didn't give me the details. Oh, ladies, he's not married. Um, the party is not over till 6: 00.- Great.- Yeah.- I'll come back then.- Okay. Oh, um, that's for Lucy. Oh, thank you. I'm sure she'll love it. It's a shirt. That sounds... divine.( Chuckles) Okay. Oh, my God. What is wrong with you?- Shut up.-( Cell phone ringing)- Did you just say\" divine\"?- Shut up. What, are you the queen?( Imitates British accent)' Ello. That's divine.( Groans) Shut up. Totally into you, by the way.( Doorbell rings)( Ring)( Ring) So we've got the results of both your tests. Now, Savannah, your F. S. H. And your estradiol levels all came back great, and your follicle count looks good, especially for a woman your age. Now, Harry, your sperm count falls in the normal range, but my bigger concern is the morphology. Uh, I'm sorry. The what? You see, normal sperm have an oval head with a long tail. Abnormal sperm has defects that can affect the ability of sperm to reach and penetrate an egg. Now this alone wouldn't concern me, but there's also the issue of low motility. I don't have to go to work today. I can call in sick. It's okay. I need to get to the restaurant early anyway. Sweetie, we should talk. Yeah. Not now.\u266a( Man) Mm.( Josslyn moaning)\u266a( Both moaning) Oh, baby. Oh.( Sighs)\u266a( Woman)* am I making it up?* What I wouldn't give to wake up with you in the morning. Mm. My ass is cold. There are multiple bedrooms we could've used in this place. Mm- hmm. Do you know how long it took me to stage those throw pillows? Absolutely not. You better get out of here, baby. I have a showing in 30 minutes. No, you don't.( Scoffs) What are you talking about? A bid was made. What? To who? This is my property. Technically, it's your home. That is, if you want it to be. Oh. You made a bid? You said your lease was up. It's close to the office. You know, I figured this could be our little love nest. Oh, my. Mmm. Oh, Mac, I can't believe you did that. Oh. Whoops. That's me. Sorry. Morning, Dr. Kim. Morning, Lila.( Cell phone rings)( Ring) Sam Grey? When did this happen? He left a few desperate messages on your voice mail yesterday, and you had a morning cancellation, so I just... Did I do something wrong? Be with you in a minute.( Cell phone rings) So since you haven't mentioned the doctor's appointment, I'm assuming it's Harry's fault that you're not knocked up? Not that we're assigning blame. Okay. It was awful. It was even worse than I thought it was gonna be. Okay, all I wanted to do was hold him. Oh, God. I hope you didn't. Of course not. The last thing Harry needs is pity right now. Oh, well, that's definitely the opposite of a nice, warm hug, isn't it? Mm. Good. I just want to cheer him up, you know, remind him how things used to be before the whole baby thing started. The little dude doesn't even exist, and he's already ruining your sex life. I also want to be treated like a sexual being, you know, I miss that. Mm- hmm. I miss us. There you go. So this house Mac wants to buy me... gorgeous, and the timing's perfect because my lease is ending. Your lease could've been renewed had you not slept with your landlord. We're all adults here. They make their decisions. I make mine. I'm a free spirit. A free spirit that doesn't mind being a kept woman, evidently.( Cell phone rings)- Hey.-( Dominic) I need you. They've replied to the court. Smith and Martin? That wasn't supposed to be until next week. Yeah, well, they replied and didn't tell us.- They're on their way over now.- Okay. Give me ten minutes. Uh, you gotta get me out of this thing. Oh, I can't. I can't. It's... You know what? You know what? Here. Just pay for it.- Pay for it.-( Keys jangle) I know I probably shouldn't be here. I just didn't know what else to do. You've been through a tragedy. It's understandable. It's more than that. The day before he died, my father and I had a fight. I said some things that now... I can never take back. What was the fight about? His affair. Your father told you he was having an affair before he died? He didn't tell me. I found a letter.( Paper rustles) Do you want to read it? Would you like me to read it? It's nothing terribly creative. Just a declaration of her love. But I need to talk to this woman. Why? Even if you knew who she was, how would that help you? What would you say to her? My mother said my father was alone when he died. But maybe he wasn't. Maybe... he was with her, and if she was, then... maybe she could tell me... just... I need to know my dad didn't die hating me. Sam.( Crying)( Sniffles) The difficulty arises in the parameters of the order. Well, the parameters were made perfectly clear. Your client can't touch the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial home. Well, then he's unable to pay his employee's salaries. Yes, that's the argument you put before the judge. He didn't like it then. And we hate it now. Um, if I were you, I would consider that what's in the best interest of my client is also in the best interest of your client. If he defaults on his obligation... There you go. You're welcome. Richard?( Chuckles) Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? You work at this store? Oh. No, I own this store. No. No, I knew that. I just didn't want you to think I was stalking you. You're stalking me? No. No. No. Um, this is going very bad. Very bad.( Clears throat) Hi. I heard that you owned this place, and I thought, hey, I just got this new apartment, and I have very bad taste. It's a furnished apartment, and that's probably my first mistake. Mm. Well, it depends on who furnished it. Maybe Richard Grieco. Oh.( Laughs) Thank you for laughing. Yeah, I... I think I can help you. Maybe we can start with some throw pillows and go from there.- Throw pillows?- Yeah. Excellent. Would you have dinner with me tonight? Tonight? I'll still buy the throw pillows if you say no. I just had to ask you. I think I can get a sitter by 6: 00. Great.( Laughs) Yeah. Um...- Would you like to show me the, um...- Yeah, some throw pillows. Right. Right. The throw pillows.( Telephone rings in distance) So I guess you got plans tonight, given your, uh, attire. Not at this rate. Okay, I will have your work done and on your desk by 8: 00 A. M. If you let me take a look at you in that thing. That's quite an offer. No work in mind for a mere ten seconds.( Ring)( Ring) Five seconds. Done. One, two, three, four, five. Ooh. Wow. The place looks great. Do you have a reservation? You never remember me. It's amazing. I'm Savi, Harry's wife. Oh. Right. I'll, uh, let him know you're here.\u266a Actually, I got it.\u266a Hey, baby. Mmm. Nice to see you, too. Didn't know you were coming. Yeah, I wanted to see you, and I thought maybe you would want to see this? Wow. Yeah, I was hoping that if it was a slow night, you could hand the reins over to Patrick and maybe come home early? It's not. Sorry. Well, I can wait. What are you doing? What do you mean? I'm just... trying to have some fun. And what about this is fun for me? I've spent the entire day trying to forget about this morning. Oh, my God. Harry, I am so sorry.- I was just trying...- Trying to what? Can I please get back to work now? Yeah. Actually, this is a fabulous craftsman. It's closer to hancock park, which I know isn't ideal, but if you like this style, then I know... Sorry. I know we're dragging you around the earth on this.- Sorry.- No. Well, for the money I'm willing to spend, I want it to be perfect. Naturally. And I... but I do like this one. It's sweet.- The breakfast nook and...- Yeah. Yeah, it's cute. I mean, I'm not in love,- but I can see the charm.-( Cell phone rings) Hmm. That's work. I'm sorry. I'll be right back.( Beep) Should we keep looking or... There's not really much of a point. She's not here. She wears the pants. She pays the bills. And I don't necessarily mind it. Yes, you do. I would never have bothered you with it, except that I do think Sam needs someone to talk to.( Sighs) I can recommend a few people. I had no idea that he went to you. And he was crying? My poor angel. He needs closure, Elizabeth.( Sighs deeply) He especially fixated on the fact that Thomas was alone when he died. I never should have told him that. No, it's best Sam knows the truth. But it's not the truth. He wasn't alone. I was with him. But I thought... I assumed... That he did it to himself? When the time came, he asked for my help, and I gave it to him. Thomas said that's why you gave him the prescription, for when things got too painful... and they did.( Crying) I know I never should've lied to Sam, but he would never understand the truth, and I know he'd never forgive me for taking away his chance to say good- bye.( Sniffles) You did the right thing for Sam... and for Thomas. I should go.( Sniffles) Thank you, Karen. You've done so much for us.( Beep)( Cell phone rings)( Ring)( Beep) Hey, lady. What are you doing?( April) Are you busy? No, unfortunately. Good. I need you. I have a date. Mm! Is it hot dad? Yes.( Laughs) I made the mistake of calling Joss to ask her what to wear, so now she's coming over, and I need you to intervene when she tries to dress me up like a glittery whore. Please, Savi. Get out here, you sexy beast. Amazing! Are you sure this amount...-( Door closes)- of glitter is age- appropriate? No. No. No. It brings out the sparkle in your eyes. You look amazing. Oh, April, you look lovely. Thank you. She doesn't believe me. By the way, I just saw Lucy try to put play- doh up Ella's nose. The sitter is late. Let me just go deal with her. No. No. No. Let Joss deal with it. She's great with kids. Fine. Just do not let her wear flats. Okay. Let's see what we have to work with here. Oh, honey, you own paisley, like, a lot of paisley and floral chiffon.( Telephone rings)( Ring)- What?-( Ring) What if it's the ghost caller?- What if it's your date?-( Ring)( Ring)( Beep) Hello?( Beep) Okay. That's it. I'm putting my P. I. on this. We're gonna trace the number. I can't go. What? That was a sign. No, that was a crank call. Can you please call Richard and tell him I'm sick?( Doorbell rings) Oh, God. It's too late. He's here.( Dog barking in distance) Karen. What's wrong? Everything.( Josslyn) Now I know why we haven't seen you in so long. I'm sorry. It was just easier to avoid everything and everyone. I didn't want to have to lie to your faces. You could've told us the truth. You would've told me to stop seeing him. I wouldn't have told you that.( Laughs) I've always known that there was something between Tom and me for a long time, but when he told me he was sick...( Voice breaks) I just wanted to be with him. And I convinced myself that it was okay, that we were soul mates. Maybe you were.( Crying) No, because in the end, he chose his wife. That's who he wanted to be with in his last moments, which means the whole time, I was just... a mistress.( Scoffs) I'm so sorry, honey. It's the worst feeling in the world, losing the person you love.( Josslyn) No offense, but I feel worse for his kid. Sounds like he's a mess, you know? I know. I feel like I owe it to Sam to help him. I just don't know how. You have to cut ties with the son and the wife. What? I can't just abandon them. Karen, this is a malpractice suit waiting to happen. If anyone finds out that you were sleeping with your patient, let alone prescribing him lethal doses of morphine, Karen, you could lose your license. I know, but Sam's in pain, and he's Tom's son. Yeah, but he's not your son, and you're not Tom's wife.( Telephone rings) Are you being stalked, Savannah? What? Rick Anderson left this. Says he's been tracking some numbers for you. Have you been getting obscene phone calls? It's for a friend. Oh. You want some obscene phone calls? I can do that. April, it's Savi. Listen, call me as soon as you get this message, okay? Is this what you do all day, talk to your friends on the phone? Told you I could've been a lawyer. What are you doing here? I need a favor. My landlord officially kicked me out. Mm, so are you moving into Mac's house? Yeah. No, that's not gonna work out. Because you realized he was sequestering you away just to have sex with you whenever it pleased him? Yes, Savi. Okay? You were right, and that's why I thought we should spend more time together, so that I can learn these valuable life lessons from my big sister. What is it? What do you need? You always said I could move into the pool house if need arose. It's arisen. Hmm. Please. Fine.- Really?- Yes. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. What is happening over there? Ooh. Not for you. Oh. Mmm. I can't believe it's come to this. Come to what? Aren't we doing freudian thing where you whip out a ball, ask me to play catch, repair my inner child?( Laughs) No. Good.' Cause I throw like a girl. It's impossible to imagine what goes through a person's mind when they know they're about to die. With your dad, all he wanted was to revisit the happiest moments of his life. He coached your little league here? He did. You made a double play right there to clinch your championship that year. And that was one of his happiest moments? Not because you won, but because when you won, all the players on your team rushed each other to celebrate, but you rushed to your dad. I remember. His last few weeks, he came here every day. So I think... whatever you said to him, whatever you regret, it didn't take away from the love he had for you. Was it you? Were you the one he was sleeping with? No, Sam, I wasn't. It's time to move on. Thank you. Thank you so much. Are you sure this is where the calls came from? Well, the last one at least. Okay. Here it is.( Sighs) Yes? Can I help you? Hi. Um, I'm April Malloy, and I've been receiving phone calls... prank calls, I guess... and they were traced to this room, so... That's weird. How long have you been here? Uh, we checked in two days ago. We? My son and me. You know what?( Chuckles) He has this obsession with phones. Maybe that's what happened. So sorry. Scottie, sweetie, come here and apologize to this nice woman. Oh, no, no, no. That's fine. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Thank you.( Door closes) You okay? Oh, I feel so stupid. No. No, honey, don't feel stupid. It's not stupid. He was the best man I ever knew. But I have to let go. I'm ready. I really think I'm ready now. I know you are.( Crying) Thank you. It's okay. Let's go.( Josslyn) This is gonna take me five minutes to clean up. I promise. You're late for work, aren't you? Running out now. By the way, Joss is only staying here until she finds a place. Sorry I didn't ask you first. It's fine. A little passive- aggressive on your part, but whatever.( Sighs) Is that how we're doing it now? Doing what? Talk to me, Harry. What do you want to talk about? I don't care. Anything. Just if we keep going at it like this, it's only gonna get worse. How much worse can it get? I mean, you showing up last night in that desperate getup was an all- time lie, don't you think? I was trying to connect with you. Right. Okay, because honestly, that's something I haven't felt in a long time. Right. And that's my fault, is it? No, I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just... I'm trying to figure out what comes next. What comes next? Okay. Well, that's easy. We can, uh, stop counting days and we can stop taking your temperature and doing all that other crap, and you can stop worrying that having a baby is gonna prevent you from making partner. That's not fair. But it's true, though, right? I mean, come on. Somewhere inside you must be a little relieved.- Stop. Okay?- You're the one who wanted to talk.- Stop. Stop!- You're the one that wanted to talk!( Crying)( Sobbing)( Seagulls cry)\u266a( Door closes) Oh, hi. Hi. Uh, where's Sally? Oh. She changed her mind again, didn't she? I am so sorry. She woke up this morning, totally freaking out, because now she doesn't want to live near the water. It was a whole... It's okay. We'll keep looking. Alex, it's totally fine. Uh, really, I would understand it if you want to drop us neurotic lesbians. It's a lot to deal with. Probably not your thing. I wouldn't exactly say that. Besides, you know what? I love a proper challenge. So... Oh. Why not?\u266a( Exhales deeply) Well, for what it's worth, I could totally see myself living here. Yeah, me, too.\u266a( Door bells jingle) I was halfway to your house when you called and canceled on me last night. Oh, no. I'm sorry. You should be. I bought a new shirt and everything.- You did?- No.\u266a Look, I just want you to know that that was a onetime freak- out. I promise it wouldn't happen again if you ever ask me out again, which you probably wouldn't. That's true. I could. I never thought about that. Richard, would you like to go out to dinner with me sometime? How about tonight? Tonight? I don't know I if could get a sitter, and... and this morning, it looked like Lucy was about to get pinkeye. Tonight sounds perfect. Pick me up at 8: 00. Okay. You don't know where I live.( Laughs) No. Good morning, gorgeous. Not today, Dom. Sorry. Isn't that Thomas Grey's wife?- Mm- hmm.- What is she doing here? Michael's been with her all morning. Apparently, since she denied the autopsy, insurance is trying to deny the claim. The firm's getting into it. Doctor, Sam Grey is here to see you. Did he make an appointment? No. Sam, come in. What are you doing here? These are for you, to thank you for everything. But mostly I just wanted an excuse to see you again. Sam, I can't see you, but, uh, I can recommend you to another doctor. I'm not here to see you as a patient. Oh, no. Sam... I want to take you for coffee if you have time.- You have to go. I have a patient now.-( Cell phone rings) I'll call you.( Ring) Oh. Hey, Savi. Hey. I only have a minute, okay, but there's some question about Thomas' death. Yeah, the insurance company is launching an investigation that my firm is handling. Now it's probably just a routine thing, but I thought you should be aware. Stay away from that family. I will. Yes. Thanks, Savi.( Beep) Oh.( Chuckles) I'm sorry. What are you doing here? How did you... I wasn't expecting you yesterday. I... I've been trying to work up the nerve for weeks to actually talk to you when I called. Who are you? My name is Miranda. I knew your husband. We were in love. I'm sorry. You have to get out of here. You have to get out of here right now. And I was pregnant when he died.( Siren wailing in distance) I thought you left. No. I wanted to get a jump on this work. You okay? You need some help? No, it's okay. You sure? I can stay if you want. No. I'm fine.-( Sets folder down)- I should go. I'm fine. You don't seem fine. It's okay to let go, Savannah. You don't... you don't have to be strong for me.( Alex Clare's\" Damn your eyes\" playing)\u266a I can do what I want\u266a\u266a I'm in complete control\u266a\u266a that's what I tell myself\u266a\u266a I got a mind of my own\u266a\u266a I'll be all right alone\u266a\u266a don't need anybody else\u266a\u266a I gave myself a good talking- to\u266a\u266a no more being a fool for you\u266a\u266a I remember\u266a\u266a how you make me want to surrender\u266a\u266a damn your eyes\u266a- synced and corrected by chamallow-- www. addic7ed. com", "imdb_url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2312059", "imdb_id": "tt2312059", "year": "2013", "rated ": "TV-14", "genre": "Drama, Romance, Thriller", "plot": "Savannah and her husband are faced with fertility issues, and finds herself attracted to a colleague; April becomes convinced that her husband is alive; Karen deals with the ramifications of an affair.", "language": "English", "country": "United States", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk0MTkyNjU2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk1Nzg3MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "imdbRating": "N/A", "type": "episode"}

And we want this to be your very last way station ever, ever, ever. What's it gonna be, Kelsey? Where'd you get the drugs? It was me. I did it. Here. [ ringing ] Ok. Let's go. Time's up. Mariana! My turn.- Girls take longer.- No, no, no. But this isn't fair.- Get out.- Just gimme a second. [ Brandon ] You're not supposed to be on the computer.- If Moms find out they're gonna ream me.- This sucks. Yeah, well you shouldn't have been giving away your freaking pills. Come on. Let's go. [ bell rings ] About time. Yeah. It hasn't been like 15 extra minutes of anything. So. thank you for that. What are you doing? I gotta pee really bad.- [ shower running ]- What? Jude!- I thought you were just...- [ Jude ] I'll be really fast! I promise! If you wanna borrow something...- Uh, no. It's ok.- Ok. I just thought you might be sick of wearing the same three things... I'm not gonna steal your earrings. I mean, what am I gonna do? Sell them at school? Don't talk about things you don't understand. Ok. Well, what don't I understand, Mariana? I mean you stole your brother's pills, you sold them at school, and then you let your brother take the fall for you. I never asked him to do that. But you let him. Buddy, can you do that in the bathroom like everybody else, please?- Come on.- What's that? We are brown baggin' I for a little while. [ Stef ] It's better for you. Go spit.- I don't eat cheese.- [ scoffs ] Since when? You had pizza like two nights ago... It's really bad for you. Can I have tuna?- If you want to make it.- Mm. All right, everyone.

I guess there's no more hot water.- synced and corrected by chamallow-- www. addic7ed. com- She spends like an extra 15 minutes in the shower I'm not even kidding. It's like my turn and they... Sounds like you guys need another bathroom... Or four less kids. I just want some privacy, really. Yeah, well I don't think my parents are going out of town again any time soon, so I'm afraid you missed your chance for privacy, mister. Well, we can figure it out. How? It's not like we'll be alone at your place ever again. Poor guy. How long is he in detention for?- All week.- Oof. That's rough. What do you care? I don't. I just feel sorry for him. What's with you? Nothing, I just... look, I feel bad enough about it, ok? Ok, but you really don't have to. Think about all the times you covered for him. He'll be fine. It's not like he ever pays attention in class anyway. Look, Jude seems like a good kid... He is. But the Parent Board is all over me on this. Obviously, we're ok giving you a little leeway, but he has to pass the proficiency exam that the other kids took to get in, or I'm afraid you're going to have to send him somewhere else... I can't send him to another school. He would be completely lost. That's part of the reason he's so behind right now. Because he hasn't had anybody to look out for him. Look, I'm not unsympathetic, Lena... The only sense of security this kid has in the world is his sister. Separating them would be terrible for him. Look, I'm trying to protect you here, too. You know how this works. Our funding is based on performance. And now I have a new seventh grader who jumped the wait list, who isn't operating at even close to grade level. Is it possible we could just give him more time? Before he has to take the exam, I mean? I know if I just had a little while to get him caught up I could... Lena. He passes the exam on Friday, or he's done at Anchor Beach. [ Timothy ] Now, he's guilty, insofar as he did commit the crime, But he doesn't feel that way until he actually gets caught. Ok. I want everyone to write about guilt in their journals this week. Wait, write? Like with a pen? Like longhand? Yes, like longhand. And don't worry. No one's gonna read it. It's just for you to get in the habit of writing every day. [ school bell rings ] Ok, guys. Seriously, I want you to write about whatever it is that you feel weird or ashamed or guilty about. You'll feel better about it, I promise. Weak, Foster. Very weak. And quit\" nudging\" me online.- Hey, meet me tomorrow.- Meet you? Why? You're in detention all day, remember? I'm gonna have Douglas let me go to the bathroom. So, two o'clock. I'll meet you by the lifeguard stand. I don't know. I have to think about it. Foster! What? I'll see you tomorrow.- What are you doing?- Nothing. Talking to Lexi. What's the big deal? No classes, no extra- curricular, no fun. In school detention and home. Period. But we've got a game this week. Not my problem. Jesus, you gave away your pills. Do you not understand how serious that is? This could have been a lot worse. Use your legs, B. You're not using your legs. The twins are both mad because Moms moved Callie and Jude into their room and not mine, so like everyone's all... everyone's all tense all the time. [ Mike ] That's more like it. Nice. You want some water? Yeah. So, I was thinking, maybe you might wanna spend some more time at my place? Maybe even move in with me. Why? Well, you know I mean, the new kids in the house. The place is busting at the seams... I only get you the one night a week. You're going be going off to college before too long... and I kinda feel like I'm missing out.- Really?- Yeah. Could be fun. Why not? Look, you don't have to say anything. Just think about it and let me know. You mind?- What?- The song. It's annoying. You're in a good mood tonight... I'm always in a good mood. You're in a really good mood tonight. Are you... is there someone you haven't told me about? What? No. Really? Nothing's going on? Nothing at all? Nothing between you and Lexi? Not at all. That's not what it looked like this afternoon. When? At volleyball? We were just talking. I was helping her with her kill. [ scoffs ] With her kill, really? What can I say, I'm irresistible... Relax. You know I wouldn't date one of your lame friends anyway. Right? So, I won't be able to go to school with everyone else? No, no, no. Honey, listen, all we need to do is give you the test, and once you pass it, everything's gonna be fine. If he passes it. Well, yes, but all he needs a 65 or better, and we're good to go. You can do that, right? This isn't fair. No, it's not. But this is what I want to suggest, Jude, you and I are going to spend this week getting you ready, and that way you will ace it for sure. Deal? Ok, remember to convert to a fraction first.- Good.- Hey, B.- Hey.- Hey.- How were the batting cages?- Oh, uh, good, you know. Yeah? What's up? Uh, bud? I think we got some good work done tonight. So, why don't you run upstairs and get ready for bed.- Night, Bud.- Night Jude, we'll be up in a minute. What's up, babe? Uh, um... Uh, Dad kinda... asked me to move in with him today. Wow. Well, he never mentioned anything to me. And I really think that he should have talked to me first. Yeah. I guess. Um. All right, well... don't worry about it. I'll talk to him. Yeah, ok... I said, I'd think about it. Well, there's really nothing to think about. I mean, it's not your choice. It's not really your father's either, for that matter. What do you mean, I don't get a choice? Why not? Because you're, um...- you're still a kid.- I'm 16. Yes, that's exactly my point. You're 16, you're not an adult yet. [ muttering ] This is bull. I'm sorry? This is bull. I should get a say in this. Well, you don't. And we are done talking about this. Oh, right. Ok, we're done talking about this. Yeah,'cause that's, that's your answer for everything. Ok, let's just take a deep breath... Right, B. Because you're a prisoner being held captive in this charming Craftsman in Mission Bay.- Stef...- What? When did I ever get to choose anything? Did I get to choose for you to divorce Dad? Did I get to choose who I was gonna live with? You were five! Come on. How about choosing if I have two moms... did I get to choose that?- That's enough, Brandon.- Why? Because I'm not doing exactly what you want me to do? No, because you're being disrespectful. Oh, I'm being disrespectful? How about you have a little respect for someone else! You need to stop talking right now. Right, of course I do! Because that's your answer. Anytime anyone disagrees with you, it's stop talking! Be quiet! Do it my way! You need to watch yourself, young man.- Watch this, Mom.- Brandon! If you leave this house. [ Lena ] Stef. Stef! Let him go. He needs to cool down. And so do you... Are you gonna be up much longer? I can't sleep with the light on. I'm not just some selfish bitch, you know... [ Callie ] Ok. I didn't sell the pills for me. It's not like I bought a new dress or something. [ Callie ] Then why'd you do it? For my birth mom. Did you hear me? I'm listening.- [ television plays ]- [ door opens ] [ television stops ] Where were you? I went to Aiden's. [ sighs ] You don't do that. You don't walk away. I know, I know. I was just... I'm sorry. I know. I'm sorry, too... for raising my voice. But that can't ever happen again. You can get mad at me all you want to, but you are not allowed to walk away. It won't happen again. I promise. Ok. And, and... for the record, I... I love having two moms. That's good. Um, you really made your point, Brandon. I spoke with Lena and it's up to you... where you want to live. You can stay here, or you can move in with your Dad. It's your choice. Just let us know what you decide. Well, don't stay up too long.'Cause it's late, ok?- Ok.- All right, love. You're back. That was some fight, man. You heard that? We all did. So what happened? They're letting me decide. Really? Wow. I mean, moms are gonna be devastated if you go. And my Dad will be devastated if I don't go. You wanted to choose. Good luck with that. I just think, I mean, we're gonna get a lot more time alone. I just hope my moms don't get too upset. Brandon they'll be fine. Really. You can go visit them, you know, whenever... with all those kids in the house I doubt they'll even notice. Very good. I thought you'd have a lot of guilt. Good. Very nice. Lose your pen? Ok. Nice. Good. [ Timothy ] Good. I see some of us are still wanting for inspiration. Tell you what, why don't you and Wyatt come see me after school today and we can see if we can get those juices flowing.- [ students laugh ]- That's not what I meant. You're incorrigible. Look it up. Every single one of you should know what that means. Ok, turn to page 45. So, we gonna talk about the elephant in the car or what? Not much to say. You wanted Brandon to have a choice. He does. You could've told him no. I tried. It didn't go well. Hey, can I have a breakfast burrito, extra salsa, please?- You got it.- Thank you. So what, you just gonna be mad at me? I don't know, Mike. Do I wish you had talked to me about it first? Sure. Would I have agreed to let B decide? Probably not. So, maybe this is for the best. But I'll tell you what you blind- side me with something like this again I'm gonna bury you deep in the desert. Fair enough. Sucks being blind- sided, don't it? So, all of this with Brandon is just payback? For what? Figuring out I was gay and leaving? It's a little late for payback, Stef. I think so. Mike, come on. If you're gonna rehash our marriage for ten hours a day, I'm going to ask Roberts for another partner. Seriously. Stef, it's not payback... it's regret. It's me growin' up. I got a kid who's going off on his own. I'm just trying to do something right.\u266a Everything you needed done\u266a Hey. So, Talya told me the news... Huh? You're moving in with your Dad? Yeah. Um, it's not... this might be stupid, but it's not because of me and Jude, is it? No. No, no, not at all. Just'cause I mean, from what I can tell, you seem pretty happy in the house.- Yeah.- Hot water not withstanding. I am, I am. I mean, it's my house. It's where I grew up. So, why are you leaving? Hey, shouldn't you be in class right now? We are. Drama. Leslie wanted to make sure the posters went up today, so... How'd you get out of ISS? Oh, told Douglas that I had to take a leak. I should probably get back.- Listen...- Yeah? Thank you so much, for what you did. Telling Moms all that. You didn't have to do that. It's cool. I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate it. You really are the best brother... Foster! Foster. Hey! So, what happened? Douglas wouldn't even let you out to use the bathroom? Well, then what? I was sitting there for like half- an- hour. I'm sorry'bout that.\" Sorry'bout that?\"- That's it?- I don't... I don't think this is a good idea. Why not? You know why...' Cause of Mariana? Do you honestly think that she's gonna care? I know she is. She told me. Her brother and her best friend like each other, so? Most people would see that as a good thing. Yeah, well, she doesn't. We're just gonna do whatever Mariana wants? Try using those to write with. I don't think it's gonna happen, Timothy. Maybe we're just not writers. Have you ever heard of Joan Didion? No? She's a writer. Tough lady. Kind of a pill. She called writing,\" a hostile act.\" A way of\" imposing your will on the world.\" Now, I don't mean to point fingers, but... two of the three people in this room seem a little hostile. To me, anyway. The thing is, that sort of writing takes real courage. And you don't strike me as someone who is afraid of much... Come on. Come on. One line. One thing that's been rattling around in your head forever. [ Timothy ] One thing you feel terrible about. Get it out. Get it down on paper. And see what happens.- [ Mike ] Hey, Bud.- Hey. Ready. Where we going? The Grill? No, my place. I thought I'd cook something tonight. Seriously? Yeah, seriously. It's not like I never cooked before. Unless it's pasta? B, I'd be very careful. Seriously, he cooked me a piece of fish once in 1997, I can still taste it. I'll have him back by nine. I know. I'm gonna get a snack. Do you want anything? Oh, hey don't do that. Uh, we'll eat in front of the TV. I finally got the surround sound hooked up. Ok. Oh and hey... you know, if you move in, we could move that table out of the way, and you could put your keyboard and stuff there. Yeah, yeah, that would be... that's cool. Yeah, I mean, you know if...- Right, yeah, of course.- No pressure. Yeah. Hey what's... what's this? Oh, that? You like it? I made it. You made it? Yeah. That's the ship I was on when I was in the Navy. Yeah, I remember the name but... you made this? Good job, Dad. Remember, this is half base times height. I keep forgetting the formulas. Maybe I'm just not smart enough. Oh, honey. You are plenty smart. And trust me, I know smart. Considering you went to, what? Six different schools in the past four years, you're doing really great... Seven. Seven different schools. [ sighs ] [ television plays ] So, you still playing poker? Uh, no. How come? I mean I remember you used to brag all the time about milking those guys for beer money... Ah, you know... you do something for a while, people get busy then... I don't know. You just let it go. Too bad. It happens, kid.. I gotta get you home. I mean, I can text Mom. So, we can finish the movie.- Yeah?- Yeah. Ok. Hey, I got an idea. Let's play a game. Why don't you run up and grab everybody and get something out of the game closet? [ doorbell rings ] Hey, Talya. Come on in. Uh, Brandon's not here, though. Tonight's the night he has dinner with his Dad, remember? Oh, shoot. I forgot. That's ok. You're welcome to wait if you want. He should be here soon. And we're just about to play a game, if you'd like to join.- Yeah, sure.- Ok. Why don't you throw that stuff in Brandon's room.- Hey, Callie!- Hey... We're playing a game? Yes, we are playing a game. All of us? Yes, all of us. We used to do this all the time, remember? We just got out of the habit, and I think now that Callie and Jude are here, it would be fun to start the tradition again. I'm sorry, did somebody say,\" Game?\"- Really?- Mm- hm. You better get ready to lose, lady. She always loses.- See? Fun.- Fun! Fun for everyone. They're so much fun. I'm really gonna miss hanging out here. You know, now that Brandon's moving in with his Dad. Um, have you talked to him lately?' Cause I just don't think that's happening. [ indistinct chatter ]- [ Stef ] A boomerang?- [ Callie ] A boomerang...- Really, a boomerang?- A weapon of some sort.- Hey, bud.- Hey. We just started, We saved room for you. You can be the top hat. So... I think I'm gonna move in with my Dad. Ok. Cool. All right. Um, before we get started, uh, does anybody want anything? I'm gonna get some tea. Do you want anything? [ Stef ] Ok.- Hey.- Hey. So, you're really leaving, huh? Yeah. Hey, uh, thanks for letting me use this. What are you doing? That wasn't a loaner. Really? Yeah, no. It's for you. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. Just make sure you play it. So, I guess you decided you need more hot water, huh? Yeah.- Well, thanks.- Yeah. No worries. So, I'm gonna move the bed to that wall. Get like a couch in here or something. Just, really make this place a serious bachelor pad. Settle down. This is still my room. What am I gonna do without you here, man? It's just gonna be me and a bunch of girls. And Jude. Yeah. And Jude. You'll be fine. Just stay out of trouble. Yes, you. Stop giving out all your pills to every cute girl in school, for one thing. It wasn't me.- What?- It was Mariana. You're joking, right? She wanted to have some money to give to our birth mom. What the hell, man. What are you doing? Why would she do that? And why would you take the blame for her? Mariana asked me to go with her to tell Moms what she did. She was just about to say something. I looked over at her face, just at her stupid, scared face. It looked just like it did when we moved into our first foster house. And I couldn't let her do it. I mean, everyone's always mad at me all the time anyway. So, I figured, what does it matter? But at least it's over. All of this being grounded, and In- School Suspension... it was totally worth it, now that she knows what a loser our birth mom is. I mean, you know some day you're gonna have to let Mariana fend for herself. [ Mariana ] I never touched it! [ Callie ] Why would you do that?- Good luck with those two.- [ Callie ] It was moved! No one else has even been in here!- I never touched it!- Hey! Enough shouting! What is going on?- She read my journal.- No, I didn't. Well, somebody did. I left it right here second from the bottom and when I came back, it was moved.- Well, it wasn't me.- Mariana, tell me the truth... I am! I never touched it. Ok, Callie is it possible that it wasn't really moved? That you just think it was? Why? Because Perfect Mariana could never do anything wrong? Yeah, maybe you should get to know your daughter a bit better. [ Lena ] Wait, what does that mean? You know what? Forget it. Don't worry about it. You're probably right. It was probably my fault. I just forgot or something, probably. I can't live with her. Well, you have to. So, figure it out. Why'd you have to get so mad? Why can't you just get along with her?- She read my journal.- What do you care?- It's just a stupid journal.- See for yourself. You wrote about Liam? He said he wants a hostile act... Time's up, Jude. You all done? I'll correct it, and I'll let you know. I only need a 65 and I can stay, right? Yes... listen to me. Whatever happens, I'm really proud of you, ok? Go on, get to class. I'll come find you later. [ thumping noises ] What's that noise? Brandon. Brandon? Playing basketball? Oh, boy. He hasn't done that since he failed that final. I think he's feeling guilty.- About what? About leaving us?- About leaving you. Oh, please. Go talk to him, Stef. What am I supposed to say? He wanted a choice, he got a choice. He made a choice. I'm doing the best I can... That's not good enough.- What do you mean?- You don't get to do this.- Do what?- You don't get to have hurt feelings and pout.- I'm not.- Yes, you are. You have to step up. You have to go help your son. You have to put away whatever it is you might be feeling, and be the better person.' Cause that's what parents do. Oh.- Lucky.- Oh, please. I've been known to shoot a basketball or two, my friend. You and Dad were such jocks. What happened to me? Oh, come on. You got the more important stuff. You're funny and smart and talented as hell. And more than that, you're kind. And you know who you are. You know what makes you happy. That's an amazing thing for someone your age, B. Don't take that lightly. Just do what makes you happy, B, ok? You do that and I'll be fine, I promise. That's the way it works. You don't, have to take care of me or your Dad or Lena. It's the other way around. [ Stef and Brandon playing basketball ] I didn't read your journal. I know you don't believe me, and that's fine. I mean, why should you? I'm just the latest girl you've been forced to share a room with. I remember what that was like. Being passed around all the time. I don't think I ever felt safe until I got here. It took me a long time to trust anybody. So, I get it. But I didn't read your journal. [ Mike ] Yeah, comin'! Hey. What's going on? I thought we weren't moving you in till tomorrow? Um, yeah, um... about that. You ok? Yeah... I just. I, uh, I can't... You can't what? Move in with you. Ok. I just, I'm sorry. It's ok! I just, I can't leave Mom... and everybody else. Don't worry about it.- You sure?- Yeah, yeah, yeah, Look, listen... this was never supposed to be a bad thing. You do what you gotta do. I'm gonna be all right. I mean it. Ok? Is that a, uh... is it a piano? Oh yeah, yeah. I rented it. But it's fine. You can come play whenever you want. I'm sorry. Oh, about time. [ Lexi ] Sorry my parents wouldn't let me come.- Hurry up. We've been waiting forever.- Ok, we were making popcorn. Unless, of course, you don't want any? I don't think they want any. We'll just have this for us.- I'll take some.- Come on...- All right, ask nicely.- [ Stef ] Pass that down. Here we go, here we go...- [ Stef ] This is ours.- Jude? Pass it down, pass it down...- What you working on?- English homework. I have to write a story, and I need a name for the bad guy. You know we busted this dealer. Uh, his name... really bad guy. His name was Freddy.- That's a good name.- What about Sanchez? Like your boss? No, no, no. Jude, you cannot use that. Does it have to be a boy? Or can it be a girl? How about Liam? Hear one you like? Good. All right, Lena. Back in your seat. Let's go. No talking. Anybody. Quiet. I've killed for less. Talking during the movie.- [ Lena ] What about you?- [ Stef ] Hm? All right, here we go.
